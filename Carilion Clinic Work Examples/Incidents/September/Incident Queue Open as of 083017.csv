Sent email to Tina Bradshaw and Melodie Warren to request follow up -


This incident is related to a chart correction that needs coding to make corrections before this can be resolved.  Is there someone that can address the changes needed?

I believe Elaine Montgomery was the one making the request.  Below is what is in the incident, I am not sure if this provides you the details needed, or if you need more information.  If so, can you check back with Elaine?

CHART CORRECTION - I was contacted by Legal who is working on Guardianship/Conservator paperwork for this patient and his date of birth and last name are incorrect. Also, documentation in his chart refers to him as a 60 year old male when he is actually over 70 years of age. Following is the email I received:

  ""I'm working on a guardian/conservator petition for a patient at CRMH, and the record has an incorrect birth date, which the patient has acknowledged is incorrect.  The social worker contacted Patient Access to request a change of the birth date but was told that change cannot occur until the patient is discharged.  The problem is that, in multiple progress notes, the physicians are referring to the patient as a ""60-year old male,"" when he is actually over 70 years old.  The patient's MRN is 998939, last name is Berrman; however, the medical record appears to still refer to him as Berriom.  Long story short, this patient has utilized multiple aliases, but his social worker Brittany has received confirmation of legal name and birth date from Social Security and the VA.  You likely want to reach out to Brittany to get additional information on this patient issue.""   I have reached out to Legal and asked for Brittany's last name and phone number.

She has agreed to do this.

I will also contact the Staffing Office and ask them to do the same thing. I have sent an email to Kathy Ott and attached a reminder notice to be hung up next to the staffing computer. The attachment I sent is on the attachment tab and the email is pasted below:

Subject: Kronos - 2 Items

Kathy,

I have 2 items for you – 1 is a request for the Staffing Office, the other is for your review:

1.	When Kevin and I were there last week to meet with Brandie & you, we were talking to Karen Reese while she was doing some staffing. She casually mentioned an error that she has been seeing pop up recently that we thought had disappeared. It happens to be the same error that Rose Hurd has reported. Until Karen said something, we thought just Rose was getting it because no one else had reported it. The error doesn’t keep the user from doing anything or information from saving, it’s mainly an annoyance, but still needs to be fixed. We are working with Kronos to solve. I was on the phone with Rose and a Kronos support person this morning and he would like to see if this error is related to the version of Citrix we are currently running. To test this we are asking Rose to not use the Kronos icon on the desktop, but instead open Firefox and type Kronos.carilion.com to get to Kronos. Will you also ask the Staffing Office to do this? We would like for them to try this for a week to see if going around the Citrix server gets rid of the error. I’ve attached a note that can be posted in the staffing workspace as a reminder for them. We would like to get a report of results at the end of next week. Doesn’t have to be detailed – just “didn’t see the error at all today” or “still had the error 2 times”, etc. The error we are looking for is NGUI – 00090 and will come up in a box with a pink header.

We are still trying to track down this error. Another user is now reporting it as well. When is a good time for Kronos to be able to observe your use of Kronos to see if they can catch it as it happens?

Kronos has not been able to replicate this error in house; they can see the error in the data log, so they know it happens. Are you still receiving the error? If so, is there a time that would be good for them to remote in to watch as you work to see if they can catch the error as it happens?

Thanks!

Beth

Spoke with Savorn Kong at Kronos on 8/2/17; he is still looking into this issue, along with a couple of other issues and will work on trying to replicate in their system using a copy of our test database.

Subject: Update on Kronos issues

Rose,

I just wanted to follow up with you about your open tickets with us about issues in Kronos.

Kevin may have already followed up with you – but he has opened a case with Kronos Global Support (KGS) about the names & schedules not lining up. Kronos requested a copy of our test environment database so that they could attempt to reproduce the problem themselves and try to find a solution. We were able to get that to them yesterday. You are not the only user to report this scrolling issue.

I opened a case with KGS about the NGUI-00090 error that you are receiving. They will also be using the copy of our database to see if they can get that error message to show up for them. We also sent a copy of the database logs that show the error during the time that you received it. This will help them research if there was something else going on in the system at the same time. We still have not received any other reports of other users having received this error message. Do you know of anyone else who has seen this message pop up? Are you still getting this error on a regular basis?

We will let you know when we get any further updates from Kronos about these issues.

Thanks!

Beth

Spoke with Rose - she received error as she was editing an employee's schedule

Activities performed:
1. Previously edited shift time to indicate employee staying over original shift end time & added comment saying that employee was staying longer than originally planned
2. Checked timecard to see what time employee actually left
3. Went back to schedule and edited the shift again to remove extra time at the end of shift because employee did not actually stay longer; also removed comment
4. Click save and receive error
5. Change is actually saved, but still get error message.
6. Click OK on error message and confirm that change has been saved

Talked to Rose - this is an error that has been happening for several weeks; she is just now reporting - it is one that should have been resolved witih SR13. Could not replicate while I was on the phone.

Client has the Outlook thick client installed on his Mac and it is pointing directly to EXCH-PRD-HTCAS4 which no longer works to my knowledge.

Charles:
We had the workflow tracer installed on this device because of issues with a fatal error that terminated Epic sessions on the device. I cannot get the doctor to notify me if/when the tracer has been activated, so I am trying to get to the bottom of this issue despite that. I talked to my Epic TS yesterday and she is willing to look at all of the log files associated with this device (ISC90781) if they can be attached to the open SLG 3376518.

Would you be able to retrieve the files and attach them? If there are space issues (I know that there are 24+ files there as of 8/23 per Kipp), please grab the first 3 and last 5 if at all possible.
08/23/17 11:40:22 US/Eastern (DAPOORE):
SE reports 24 log files on this device. I emailed provider that I needed at very minimum a date & did he remember any details on the existing files. If not, then moving forward he will have to let me know when it happens again otherwise, I will close the ticket since I cannot proceed without this information.
08/23/17 10:13:04 US/Eastern (DAPOORE):
I called the provider. He reported the error has continued to happen since the upgrade. He reports when the error happens & terminates the session, sometimes the workflow tracer is no longer available. When this happpens, he hits the tracer when he restarts the application.

emailed KCarico to add tracer log files for this device to the SLG. I have asked him to attach any files they obtain from this device since the user cannot remember when it happens & does not contact us when it does even after repeated requests to do so.

SLG updated
08/23/17 10:10:17 US/Eastern (DAPOORE):
discussed with Epic TS
08/15/17 13:13:51 US/Eastern (DAPOORE):
Updates SLG with following info:
I have not heard anything from the user. I asked our guys to see if any additional log files were present on this device. Turns out when we upgraded that they do not automatically add the workflow tracer back to devices. I have asked that this be added back. I will also contact the client to ask if if it has happened since the upgrade & to use the tracer if it does. Thanks

Javon added the workflow tracer to the device in the ticket & uploaded some files to the Epic SLG 3340846 on 8/4. These files didn’t reveal the needed information so we asked the doctor to continue to use the tracer. I have been on vacation & have not heard anything from the provider. I cannot reach him to ask if he has had the error recur & clicked the workflow tracer.

Would you be able to check & see if there are any additional log files on this device & if so, post them to the above SLG? Thanks

While using Dragon Medical One, the users are unable to dictate into the Diagnosis field on the AMB side. This helps the providers save a lot of time typing out long dx codes for dx entry.

This ticket should go to the Medical Imaging team since they own Dragon now. This will have to be discussed with Nuance and potentially Epic. It can also be researched at TSG with the SA/Medical Imaging teams.

This workflow worked prior to the upgrade so it is likely not a Dragon issue but an Epic issue or some other system that changed with the upgrade.

Research and reaction to Cactus technical support information.  Email copied below.  Summary - Carilion Cactus NPDB account holder must login to NPDB site and confirm user account information.
====================================
Hello Cheryl and Karen.

Cheryl - Thanks for recently helping me test the Cactus access to the NPDB site via NPDB QRXS query.  Here is the message generated by our test: To ensure account security, the account holder must sign in

According to Cactus support this following needs to occur:


-  The 'account creator' in Cactus for the NPDB has to login to the NPDB and verify that the correct people are in the NPDB account.  This is not Cactus related and is required as part of NPDB security.  (see attached for screenshots - Karen looks to be setup as NPDB account holder)

-  NPDB may ask to verify an IP address.  Cheryl and I saw this step, but we still received the message indicated above.

-  According to Cactus, after the account information is verified and the correct all should be successfully access the NPDB data.


Karen - As the current account holder, are you able to login to the NPDB site and verify the account and the people associated with the account?  Cactus support verified that in our case, the System Administrators are not part of the account setup in environment.



Thanks,

Email sent to Cactus support below.
-  research
-  worked with Cheryl Clark to test
-  confirmed Cheryl can access the NPDB site directly with her account, but query Error Details indicate that 'account holder must sign in'
-  email sent to Cactus support requesting further assistance

================================
Regarding NPDB access and response below.  We confirmed that the .NET Framework key value is 379893.  We also confirmed no host files and that the below web addresses can be reached on our Cactus Citirx server.

Additionally, I tested with a user that has an NPDB account and can successfully login to the NPDB site.  When she runs the NPDB query from within Cactus, the query fails with the Error Details description - 'To ensure account security, the account holder must sign in'.  Please see attached screen shot of the Error Details and Query Status.

Request further support assistance.  Query user can be available for further troubleshooting as needed.

------------------------------------
Hi Kevin,

As we just discussed on the phone about the credentialing issue you are having in 3.14.31, I can have a Support representative reach out on Wednesday when you are free to assist with the cred counts utility/cred fix utility.

Regarding the ""Error opening connection to Data Bank server, check Internet"" NPDB error, here is some more information that will help you and the rest of your IT team with ensuring all settings are good to go on your side with the NPDB using Visual CACTUS 3.14.31.

First, if any host files are used on local computers or servers, the new NPDB address will need to be mapped. The new address is http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/ with an IP address of 54.186.167.170 on port 443. Unfortunately, the NPDB has lingering issues with migrating all its old addresses, or alternatively, forwarding old DNS addresses to its new location. For example, http://npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov/ is no longer valid, but http://www.npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov correctly forwards to http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/. To connect, you will want to ensure host files, routing, and firewalls at all levels account for these changes.

Also, you will want to verify that the end users are running Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher on their workstations. The easiest way to verify this is to go to the registry on the workstation and verify the build. You will want to go to
Start > Run > regedit.exe, then navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full.

Hi Kevin and Stacy,


There is a process within Cactus that queries a National Provider database (NPDB).  This query has not been working for awhile and the clients desire to resume this functionality.


Please review the questions below presented by our Cactus support representative.  Time can be logged to IM396380.

Hi Jessica,
This research was done back on 8/14 by a team mater of mine but it didn't get communicated to you.  Let me know if this is the situation with the other account examples you have:
""Looking at the PB account in question 805538365, this patient has two different Guarantor Accounts, one is Auto and the other is P/F. The other coverages for the patient do not appear because this HAR is attached to the Auto Guarantor which only has Generic Auto attached to it. The patients P/F account has the Medicaid coverage attached to it. This has been the behavior all along. I pulled up version 2015 and looked up this account and only the Auto appears as well. Sending this to the training team to contact the user and explain.""
Thanks,

Thank you for the examples. The charge sessions are splitting because the Service Providers are different.  See example below.  All information must match for the charges to be included in one charge session. This does not affect claims. The charges will be pulled back together during claim run.

I like your idea.  If you find that certain S codes are coming up as common overrides, we can code around those if that makes sense. One suggestion - We could make these still go to wq 1362 but take away the override and instead they transfer to a new HB wq.  That way they can fix their mistakes without you having to look at them first.

Hi Cyndi,
Angie and I reviewed this ticket and I am now working on it.  So we are in somewhat of a corner, i.e., occurrence code 11 didn't get automatically added because of the ""S"" code and then the PAS user overrode the claim edit so we end up with no S code.  Here are next steps:
1) The S code on this claim is S81.801S Unspecified open wound, right lower leg, sequela.  Is that one of the S codes that is excluded from needing an accident code?  After talking with Epic, if we can get the list of S codes that do not indicate accident we may be able to improve the automated logic for adding 11 by excluding these S codes.  In the past you have stated there are a lot of exceptions.  Is it possible to pull together this list and send it over?
2) As a short-term fix, I can add a claim edit when there is no occurrence code 01-06 or 11.  This would probably need to be worked by HB.  I don't think we want to go the route of PAS updating the claim directly, at least not right now.
3) What were you doing before PAS had the override?
thanks,
Barbara

Reviewed examples.  I unbilled and re-billed one of them in SUP to verify the Occ Code 11 was missing before any edits were made to the claim and it was.  I did get the claim edit that client mentions regarding the accident Dx.
Reviewed the CDF for Medicare and see the logic for Occ Code.  For OC 11 - Onset of Symptoms/Illness, there are two lines in the table using rules 740897 & 740898.
740897 - CC HB 11 Dx Not Accident
74098 - CC HB 11 Pt Recurring

The claims for these two examples do not meet either of these rules to automatically get OC 11.  Will need to f/u with co-worker to verify that this is the only logic that controls Occ Code.  I could not find anything in the HSD.

Called the user and spoke with her. Advised that she needed to have the documents on the drive first before we could edit the Hyperlink. She said she would have this done by Monday and would call in for assistance once they have them loaded onto the drive. They are very expensive to send and can't afford to have any of these come back. Users might be using Windows/Macs to read the files.

See attached for Hyperlink editing instructions.

Escalating to myself until Monday when she calls. Will not be following up on this until that time.

I think this might have to do with an issue that we had a couple of years ago with ADT.  Will be talking to Tara when she returns from a meeting

Sometimes if an IP admission is not closed out it links together notes in the Telephone Encounter.  What will happen is when you create a new telephone note it will list every note that was done previously
Have to send to ADT to have them close the Admit
 
Here is Collen's response:
I think I found the issue here.  That patient has an admission from November of 2009 that was never closed.  It's in Endoscopy RCH, which has a setting in the profile to make encounters within 30 days of the encounter a related encounter.  The admission has never been closed, so it's relating all the encounters since that day.  The documentation section of the telephone encounters navigator only displays telephone notes, so it's only pulling in those from the ""related"" encounters.
To fix the encounters that were already linked, you'll want to close that admission and use patient station to unlink them.  You can do this by opening patient station, removing the filters on the patient, and clicking the check box next to the encounter to remove the check mark.  This unrelates the encounter.
I don't know if you'll want to change the setting or not, but it's something to consider.
I'm not sure if other patients were affected by this.  We might be able to run a search to find out, but it doesn't seem like it affects patient safety or data accuracy at all, so I don't know how critical it is.

Response from Nuance

Typically when it comes to  delays or freezing issues. We would advise to check on the following
•	Could you check if your antivirus exceptions are in place?
•	Could you check amount of free disk space maintained on your C:\.
•	 At times, these time lags could be due to unwanted data present within the profile , you might have to clean up these un-necessary data from the user profiles  to ensure  steady performance for Dragon and to avoid any delays.
•	Could you check if customer is maintaining a large number of  Auto-texts and/or Custom Commands .Typically, customers who maintain a large number of Auto-texts and/or Custom Commands can experience login delays impacting their DMNE 2.x clients.  The delay duration is longest during the initial login of the user profile.  However, less pronounced delays can also occur with subsequent logins.

She said she didn't have the precise data to enter manually but wrote a quick note that the data / parameters she observed was within normal parameters and noted that patient was stable throughout the endo procedure.

Subject: IM398778 - Case with Missing Anesthesia Data


Hi Elaine / Dawn,


This is in regards to the ticket earlier in the week for the missing Anesthesia Data.  Per client for a brief moment in the middle of the case she got the Red Screen of death on her

intraop grid, after talking with her she said she had rebooted the PC several times and the Red Screen went away while patient was in Endo.  They had to transfer patient from Endo to

the OR, but said they lost her Endo Data.  This happened after hours during the weekend.  CE had the ticket and worked on the hardware issues, but she asked if there was anyway to recover her missing data.  CE transferred me the ticket on Monday.  We asked Walker with Excel if devices saved any data, and learned they do not.  Also wasn't sure how long device data is kept in the Epic System before being purged.  We were unable to recover any data and informed the client that she would have to manually enter the data.


She replied that she didn't have the precise information to manually document and did not want to make up any numbers so she wrote a quick note.  Her question was if there was anything else she needed to do and if the quick note was acceptable from a compliance standpoint.  I told her I'd check with some other folks on the team.  Copy of the note entry in the Anesthesia Record below:



Let me know if there is any other additional documentation needed, or if what she documented given the situation is acceptable for this patient's record.


Thanks,

Joe

Called client, but was unable to reach this morning, left message that I checked with vendor Excel Medical and also checked with my teammates to discuss issue.  We looked at the chart and the related anesthesia devices and did not find any data that could be imported into the chart for the missing data that the client had reported on.  Earlier ticket was transferred to us from CE to resolve connectivity issues I believe, and she had a question concerning lost data because of this.  We checked and could not find any data to import and after discussing with others on team, concluded that user would have to document data manually.  Called left message and also left my iphone# for client to call back if she had questions.

Joe, she does not have data from 1503 - 1630 in the patient's chart. She will need to enter those times manually.

Joe, I don't know if there is any other way to pull the information, was this a concern with the validation meetings during the build?

Hey Elaine,


So looking at Walker's response it does not appear any data was retained.  I looked at the patient's Anesthesia Record and looks like case started around 1500 and ended approx 2300 based on the Anesthesia Start/Stop & Data collect event times.


I looked at the interface utilities for the Monitor and Machine listed in the ticket.


Looks like RMHANMON36 stopped collecting data at 4:41pm yesterday and RMHANMACH36 stopped collecting data at 4:37pm yestarday also.  The search criteria I used was for yesterdays date 8/20 from 3pm to 11:30pm and did not have any more data past those times stopped that I could find.




If there was no data to recover to add to the chart, would the recommendation be for her to just manually enter data if she has not already done so?  I just wanted to check if there was anything else that could be done for the client before telling her we are unable to retrieve any data for her.


Thanks,

Joe

Hi Elaine,

BedComm does not retain any data, we send data to the interface as it comes in. I can't speak for the receiving end though.

Hey Elaine,



Wanted to check if you know if this might be data we can recover?  The case was yesterday, so I wasn't sure or if this is something the client would have to reenter manually?

Ticket Info:
Yvette called CE saying that she was working an endo case last night that had to be transferred to the OR.  She stated that after she went to the OR, a half hour into the case she received the red screen in epic.  She stated that when she moved to the OR it asked her if she wanted to merge the chart and she said yes.  She had vitals from the Endo portion at that time.  Once she received the Red screen she rebooted the system and she lost her vitals from the Endo portion of the case.  She still had her OR vitals.  She is wondering where her Endo vitals went.  I spoke with Joe Tan and he knows about the ticket coming.

Patient:  Earl Laprade

working with vendor on this. Rocco Garzione was not available so I spoke to George Moren. He can be reached at support@general-devices.com.

Emailed requester this:

Hi Chris, I spoke to the vendor and went over the two systems and could not find anything using that domain account. I worked with a technician named George Moreno and he checked the automatic backup and the updates and both go to their external server. The only failure they see is with uploading a log file after updating but that fails on uploading back to their server. He is keeping a ticket open as we gather more information. Next would be to know more details from our side regarding the failed logins. Such as day, time, which Carepoint PC and any details regarding the failed login try. Can you let me know what you find out and I will engage the vendor again to match up the data?

Thank you,

I sent her the below email

""Hey Mary,

Unfortunately It can not be to my knowledge. I am going to work further with EPIC, but from what I understand, the MRN was never supposed to be shown for folks who did not have no news access. Here’s the reason:

If the MRN shows after the asterisks, the user has a workaround to use that MRN to look up the patient in for instance the patient station activity and it will display who the patient is.. kind of defeating the purpose of blocking the patient’s identifiers if you can look them up by the MRN easily.

Mark says this is not a huge deal, but wanted to know if as a whole we would allow the police dept to see no news patients.



Thanks for your help!""

08/23/17 16:06:37 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Research issue further and constructed an email to the Privacy Officer at Carilion Clinic. (Below)
Hey Mary,

I received a helpdesk ticket from Mark Vest at CNRV. He is a Police Officer with access to EPIC in which the “ADT, Police DEPT” template does not have access to Confidential data (No News Patients). He and about 45-50 other Police Officers use this template in EPIC. The issue he reported is this:

Previous to EPIC 2017 – Users who DID NOT have access to No News Patients (Confidential Data) saw patients on their house Census like this - ****** (MRN# 1234565)

After the EPIC upgrade to version 2017 – Users who DO NOT have access to No New Patients (Confidential Data) see patients like this now -    ******

Therefore users who’s EPIC security were built specifically not to have No News patients used to be able to see the MRN # associated with the No News patient. Now they cannot. Police used to use the MRN # as a “Secret Password” for visitors who may be visiting a No News Patient that may be in CNRV’s Birthplace (a locked down area).

Do you think it is appropriate to give all Police Officers access to No News patients now that they cannot see any identifier at all on patients in activities like patient lists / house censuses? Mark said he would be glad to speak to you if you have additional work flow related questions.

Currently only 3 Police type folks have access to No News patients. They are the “Police Chiefs” and are on a separate Police Chief EPIC template. (Bobby Lugar, Ron Donelson, Patricia Hepburn)


Please feel free to reach out to me if you’d rather chat on the phone or in person about this.


Thanks!
08/22/17 11:26:49 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Called and spoke with Mark Vest.
He was very pleasant and just explained that they used to use the ""last four"" of the MRN to determine a ""Passcode"" for visitors for no news patients in placed such as the birthplace and St. Albans.

I am going to reach out to Mary potter to let her know what changed with the upgrade and whether or not it is appropriate for Police officers to have access to No news patients in general now that the system changed slightly on how it displays no news.
08/21/17 17:19:26 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Bret and I researched this issue.
There was a nova note about the EPIC 2017 upgrade in which No News security is actually RESPECTING the security points now.
ADT, Police DEPT were on purpose not given ""No News"" access. But they had a work around all along.
Mark is complaining they can no longer use the workaround.
I need to follow up with the Police Cheif and with Mary Potter to determine if this access is appropriate for all Police Officers.

I tried to call Mark to let him know but he had already left for the day.

I will call him in the morning.

Is there any way for TSG Imaging Team or Chart Team to pull original report out and manipulate it to appear on external result report?

Karen,
We believe this is happening because the  router logic only updates this if the original DEP includes US, Mammo and CT for Daleville and this one is for DX.  The task involved with this is VCT - PB SET POS FOR DALEVILLE IMAGING AND WESTLAKE IMAGING [100623].

Does DX also need to be included?

Hello,
Do we have an update on this?  Is there a way the clients can do what Kelly outlined below?

Thanks,

From Kelly:

When the EKG window is open, the staff need to be able to also document what they see in epic.  At this point, when the window is open, they can’t.  They have to write it down, close the window, and then enter the information in epic.

Called Kelly Saunders as I worked with her yesterday to update security so users can see the EKG reports.  She sent email to Zack at Epic:

Zack,

Coders are wanting to be able to have the EKG window up and still be able to document in EPIC like they were able to do prior to making the link a PACS link.  Anything we can do for that?

User sent me more examples.  I researched and appears to be the same cause.  Updated the SLG with this info and replied to the client that Epic is still looking at this.

I have 3 more examples the user sent me and they all have the same thing.  The person who did the ED auto undo is the person reflected in the process user.

1.  What is ED Auto undo and why have we just started seeing this since the upgrade?
2.  I know you say it should reflect but why has it never reflected a doc or nurse before the upgrade and only on these ED auto undo?

I have 2 ex. from NRV for you.

WOrked with Joyce on this.   We are now waiting on Clindoc to get back with us on what auto undo discharge is so we can try and figure out how these nurses names got in here.  We were unable to recreate but all the examples had this auto undo discharge associated with them.   Waiting on reply from Todd to further research.
08/23/17 16:16:27 US/Eastern (JWBOOKER):
Worked with Karen regarding the issue.  Created test patients in test environment to recreate the situation.  In Production found that the patients are showing in event management as an auto undo discharge event by the nurse.  This action appears to be making the RN as the process user.  I called Todd Null (on call for ASAP) and he is validating this workflow.
08/23/17 15:01:11 US/Eastern (MTNULL):
Confirmed that the Encounter Status ""Undone to Confirmed Admission"" with a reason of ""(ED auto undo)"" occurrs in the ED when a patient is discharged and the ED RN clicks the ""Undo ED Discharge/Dismiss"" button in the menu.  This feature has been available for a number of years and the IP team did not alter any configuration related to it during the 2017 upgrade.  We tested this feature in POC, SUP and RLB with the same results visible in the Patient Events Activity and in Event Management.  Is it possible that a change in Identity configuration changed to cause these events to create a deficiency?

I have received a ticket for the DVD/VCR combo in CRCH RM 203.  The VHS tapes don’t enter the machine properly and one side sticks up causing the tapes not to play.  The instructor needs this to work so he can use the tapes next Wednesday.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

So the description in this ticket seems to be accurate. They were ordered on the 16th and not drawn till the 21st.  Do you think we should have the client open the orders only encounter from the 16th and drop a charge for the venipuncture and cancel the one from the 21st?

She states that this is happening for her as well as a co-worker, only started after the upgrade.

She is going to the patients encounter, clicking notes and then clicking prenatal viatals and notes. This causes the note to open but it appears to be blank.

If she goes into the notes section of the encounter and clicks the hyperlink for the incomplete note, it will pop-up the in use message.

She is unsure what is causing this issue but states that it happens often and happens on multiple workstations.

Other provider with the same issues is Kristen Conrad.

Visited the client. He is able to connect to the WPA at McClanahan witout issue when I tried. He said he is also able to connect at CASB, Community and other sites. He said when he goes to RMH board room it will not connect. When he clicks the tray icon for the connections he does not see the WPA.

User also need a DVD drive. His has the cover coming off and it is hard to open or eject. I told him I would see if there is a used one available or if I will need to put in a request with Dell Support.

Carilion's private wifi networks. I am able to join when I am in my home building (213 McClanahan); however, consistently while working from CRMH I am unable to join the private wifi network. It doesn't even show up in the wifi network available listing.

Called the client to verify this is only happening at RMH.
He said no issue while at McClanahan only RMH.

This is both wired and wireless they are having issues with.  Internal and external network seems to keep dropping off on them.  They are seeing wireless connection drop out on mobile and laptops and reconnecting.

When running it also runs very slow at times.

This has been an issue for around a week now.  As I was speaking with them Jenny was not able to connect and her coworkers just locked up and dropped connection and the other user with them unable to get connected as well.

Hi Jesse,

The connection was just lost – could you take a look?

Thanks,

I replied:

I went and checked. Users are able to get to other sites. They tell me this db is hosted from Canada. They are going to contact the admins at the host site to see what info they can get from them.

I notice on the tsg-fs server the software is from 2002. I wonder if a newer version of the client is available.

Thanks

Jesse,

After speaking to Jenny this morning, it sounds like there may be a network issue at 213 McClanahan. The NRV location rarely has this problem. The McClanahan location will typically experience the issue in the afternoon and other software will be slow such as email.



Jenny,

The next time the connection drops, will you send the time that it happened? I can pass this information on.



Thanks,

Contacted the Enterprise Applications on-call Cindy Fallon:
Good Morning Cindy,

The clients at Employee Assistance Program at 213 McClanahan use a program called EA Expert. It tracks employee info for the cases they work. They have been experiencing the system locking up on them. I wanted to see if this is something your team can help them with.

They say the program will lock up and kick them out frequently. The contact for the issue is Jenny Mullins at 981-8951.

Thanks

She replied she would take a look at it.
08/28/17 08:50:53 US/Eastern (JDSORRELLS):
Emailed the SA on-call:
Good Morning Steve,

The clients at Employee Assistance Program at 213 McClanahan use a program called EA Expert. It tracks employee info for the cases they work. They have been experiencing the system locking up on them. I wanted to see if that is something you guys tend to or if it needs to be directed to another group.

They say the program will lock up and kick them out frequently. The contact for the issue is Jenny Mullins at 981-8951.

Please let me know if I need to contact someone else.

Thanks
08/25/17 12:24:08 US/Eastern (JDSORRELLS):
Went and spoke with the client. The connection issue is only happening in EAP Expert. Speed Test indicates 76 Mb download, 88 Mb upload. Bandwidth is not an issue.
EAP Expert folder on tsg-fs says not supportedd by IT but I told them I would check with the SA Team.

Joe, in the history section for the PST nurse, they can select Hernia. Somehow when the nurse selects Hernia the ICD code K46.9 comes up which is for Abdominal hernia.

You can see this in the patient's problem list.

Anesthesia is looking for patients who have Hiatal hernia and the K46.9 triggers the anesthesia Hiatal hernia.

Hi Elaine,



The ticket just now came in 4:20pm, guess just wanted to put the ticket in at the end of the day to make sure the weekend gets off to a good start.



Since its almost end of the day, can we get together sometime next week to get more info about what exactly needs to be changed to fix this?



Is something not mapped correctly between the procedure when patient is admitted and what gets triggered to populate in the history section?  Is that

what I'm understanding for the issue?



Thanks,

Joe

Dr Macdonald is putting a ticket in, because Hiatal Hernia appears instead of Inguinal hernia in the History section pf the Pre Eval note



The PST nurse selected Hernia in her history and it is comes up with K46.9 which is abdominal hernia.

If Dr. Weiss does not remove his documentation, can this still be done administratively by someone from our group?

Hey Elaine,

Just go in Case Entry, Select Case Actions, then select Cancel from there right?

I called up customer to assist her and she was so abusive:
1. As soon as she picked up the phone she said she could not hear me so I needed to give the phone to an American so she could talk to that person - I thought my line was bad, so I told her to give me a moment to call her back.

2. I called her back, she picked up then hanged up on me

3. I called her back again and asked her if she could explain the problem further to me so I could see how best I could help her then she started being rude and shouting that if someone said they could not login it means they could not login and that what more did I need to hear.

4. She added that I should either change her username or password for her to login...then abusively that ""that is all I need from you"" ""you claim you offer professional service, so where is the professional service...""

5. I tried to calm her down, and asked her to give me a while to change her password for her

6. While I was working through the system she kept abusing me in the background ... I did not interrupt her

7. While I was just about to change the password, she said this was taking too long then hanged up on me again

8. I did not call her back again, because I knew she was agitated about something, I did not want to engage her any further.

9. Hopefully when she is calm enough we can talk through this one more time.

Provided Wendi Lewis the discrepancies between fax number from Donna Hampton (SD863922) and Patricia Devin (SD864625) and the one provided by Wendi Lewis that is currently in the EAF record.   All are different.

Sent the following email to Wendi Lewis requesting her to contact Patricia Devins; need her approval to change fax number.
An Incident ticket (#399760) was created by Patricia Devins this morning due to Place of Service (POS) having the wrong fax number where she is unable to close a referral on a patient.

Patricia Devin created Interaction SD864625/C1213565 for the new POS 20258 Centra Lynchburg General Hospital – Inpatient.  Her request noted the fax number as 434-200-1550.

Another request for the same POS was created by Donna Hampton SD863922 / C1213428 that included fax number 434-200-7346.

We closed SD864625 as duplicate of SD863922 so the fax number in PRD is the one provided by Donna Hampton.

Patricia stated this is wrong fax number for this POS.

Please contact Patricia at 276-670-3326 to confirm changing the fax number and I’ll make this a priority for this morning.

Restarting the device does not appear to have resolved and running the tool does not fix the file (download from my side and ran the tool), she couldn't open the fixed version either.


I am unsure if this issue is related to the device only have 4gb of memory, however task manager seems to indicate 65-70% memory usage at all times which could present an issue when trying to use certain applications. This device appears to be quite old, warranty is set to expire in exactly 1 month. It has been previously reimaged due to performance issues in the past.

Cheri Hartman put in a charge for this patient on 8/11/17 and it was a phone encounter. Because she was billed a G9012  for Care Coordination The care coordination charges needs to be Medicaid and can't be billed G9012. Charges should not have been billed since the insurance is not Medicaid and patient should not be charged.

The charge is showing that it is attached to the patient's Medicare however  I am unable to complete the MSPQ because there is not an appointment showing to be able to do the MSPQ and I am unable to remove it from my claim edit wq.

For the two incident tickets, as Lynn mentioned in a previous email, I would like to close them so do I need to reach out to the site (FP Radford is the site that opened both tickets, Tammy Hicks and Karen Myers) or does RCM have someone to do that?

Thank you Aimee.  Tina – Does this give you what you need?

I’d like to close out the two incidents as they are not an issue, but rather how the system is designed to work based on Carilion’s configuration.  Is there a coding consultant from RCM that should reach out to the site?  I’m not sure who needs to own this communication.  This was an RCM decision, so they may be able to best explain the reasoning behind firing Medicare ABNs for non-Medicare patients.

 3:13:31 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
Awesome, let me confirm some systems specifics and we can fix this!
 3:14:01 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
ok
 3:14:16 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
If you need further assistance after our chat you can contact me directly at zakk_boisselle@dell.com. Before we begin, can you verify that the system having the issue is a LATI E7240 with service tag FMFPN32 and that marutherford@carilionclinic.org is the best email address for you to receive messages regarding this session?
 3:14:31 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
yes
 3:15:11 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
thank you kindly for confirming, always just like to make sure we fix the right system!
 3:15:20 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
is there any type of damage that happened to the system to cause this ?
 3:15:31 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
you have the coverage if so just like to check
 3:17:53 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
I updated the BIOS ,, tried other chargers,, I could get it to charge but if I moved the cord the mouse would stop and then it would state plugged inn not charging
 3:18:09 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
no damage that I can see
 3:18:36 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
that is very odd, thank you for confirming all of that!
 3:19:04 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
you do have accidental coverage so on the off chance if a tech finds anything it would kick in instead of the standard warranty.
 3:19:19 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
yea it is odd,,, at least I can confirm it is in the plug
 3:19:43 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
ok,,,good
 3:19:49 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
Agreed, to confirm when you plug in the adapter does the light on the brick or tip of the adapter stay on ?
 3:21:47 PM   	 Customer 	 Mike 	
The light will stay on for the power adapter and that was odd also as most of the time on a short the light will go off, but in this case on both chargers I tested with the light stayed on 2117 south jefferson street roanoke va 24016, 540-400-3870 cell
 3:22:16 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
thanks mike, one thbing I do need to let you know.

“As you know, Houston and other parts of the Texas seaboard and beyond have experienced record rainfall and continuing impact from Hurricane Harvey. Due to airport and road closures, our parts and depot facility will not be operational until further notice. We are actively working with the Global Command Center and parts facilities to understand the extent of the delay. We will provide you with more information and updates as they become available.

oh I know sorry for them in TX,,, I will let my end user know that this may be a delayed repair
 3:24:26 PM   	 Agent 	 **ProSupport Zakk Boisselle 	
agreed, as am I, I will set this up and will keep you posted about the tech coming out, since I am sending a tech out. Are there any other issues with the machine? ( broken plastics , missing rubber feet etc..)

that is good, everything els on the laptop look good

Please stand by and allow me about 7-10 minutes while I update the account and create that dispatch for an ONSITE TECHNICIAN to replace the parts. The Dispatch will be set up as Next Business Day. Barring any unforeseen shipping delays you should receive a scheduling call by 1:00 PM tomorrow to schedule service for tomorrow. If you do not hear from someone by 1:00 PM or if you have any further questions, please let me know so I can investigate the matter on your behalf.

When viewing images from R4, they are opening on the wrong screen and she has to move it to the second screen every time she wants to view an image.

I had her show me the process:

Logs into R4
Pulls up patient
Clicks to view images

The image pops up above the application and she has to move it to the 2nd screen every time.

Windows does not appear to remember the position of the image window and opens it over the application. I have checked her monitor settings are they are configured correctly, this application seems to be the only one having this issue.

She states that none of the other providers have this issue.

I have agreed to research the issue and will follow up with the provider via email to see if we can find any solutions.

Should adjustments posted with a source = ADJUSTMENT POSTING ever need to be reviewed?
If the answer is NO, it makes sense to add another line of criteria to workqueue rule BWR 2793 - HH/HO ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT TIER 1 to exclude this adjustment source.  These adjustments are posted at claims acceptance & only affect PPS payors (HH) and FC Medicare & FC Medicaid claims (HO)

From the client:
Adjustment source = Post Adjustment - Account Maintenance needs to be reviewed.  These are initiated by me the biller for my Manager to review.
Adjustment source = Adjustment Posting appears to be a system generated adjustment that is flowing to this WQ.
The ex 1 you give was originated by me and needs to be reviewed.
The 2nd ex shows this under that HAR:   HUMPHREYS, EVELYN D Adjustment Posting Debit 2,527.04   for Session 187958255

3177	HO INSURANCE ADJUSTMENTS TIER 1	HH/HO ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT TIER 1
1 6223018 - HO SIA OFFSET DEBIT ADJUSTMENT

Evelyn Humphreys does not work in our dept and I do not know why her name is attached to these adjustments that are going to this WQ.
If you look at the HAR account it has a zero balance.  I checked view all transactions.  8/4/17  which is the claim acceptance date has a credit of 3606.41.  Then medicare paid the claim on 8/21/17.  8/21 there is a debit of 3606.41.  There is also the 2% sequestration contractual and the C045 contractual.
I went into sup.  I posted the adjustment posting of 2527.04 to see what it would do to the account.  It put a balance on the account of 2527.04.  I don't understand why this WQ needs to be reviewed if they are going to put balances on the account.  It appears to resolving itself when the payment is made.

**The functionality for posting adjustments at claims acceptance, rather than at remittance posting was put into PRD on 8.10.17, so I'm not aware of any reason why these adjustments started qualifying for BWQ 3177 on 8.4.17.  I reviewed my incident spreadsheet & do not see any changes to the RMC immediately prior to that date.

The logic for BWQ 3177 - HO INSURANCE ADJUSTMENTS TIER 1 includes:
- Hospice account class
- Adjustments not approved by Level 1
- Adjustments made on Insurance buckets
- Adjustments not posted by user HB, BACKGROUND
- Adjustments between -$100.00 - $100.00

I have reviewed a couple of the charge sessions in BWQ 3177,  paying closer attention to the Adjustment Source.

1. Session 187888587 - Kafley, Bachi
HAR62310000306
-$403.26
 adj source = Post Adjustment - Account Maintenance

2. Session 187958255 - Via, William
HAR7309072
$2527.04
adj source = Adjustment Posting

Are you stating that one of these types of adjustments do not need to be reviewed?

For the two incident tickets, as Lynn mentioned in a previous email, I would like to close them so do I need to reach out to the site (FP Radford is the site that opened both tickets, Tammy Hicks and Karen Myers) or does RCM have someone to do that?

Thank you Aimee.  Tina – Does this give you what you need?

I’d like to close out the two incidents as they are not an issue, but rather how the system is designed to work based on Carilion’s configuration.  Is there a coding consultant from RCM that should reach out to the site?  I’m not sure who needs to own this communication.  This was an RCM decision, so they may be able to best explain the reasoning behind firing Medicare ABNs for non-Medicare patients.

Discussed this with Dr. Truxillo.
* He and Taylor built the physician handoff report for the 2015 upgrade.
* When adding more information, may require small font which would be difficult to read, esp since the Report prints for every patient on the patient list
* Request for more information to be added to the report will require submission of a Request for Change
* He also feels that we probably should not undertake any changes until the issue with the font is resolved.

Workaround:
Use a mobile device to view the labs with Hailu or Canto

Attempted to call client - he did not pick up the call and his voicemail has not been set up.
Will try again later
08/29/17 14:43:17 US/Eastern (MBGARZA):
Consulted with Todd Null - he suggsted checking with Dr. Truxillo, who is familiar with this build and might be able to answer the client's question on adding more information to the patient rounding reports/hand off reports.

Called client - let him know:
1) the issue with the large fonts is not something we can fix and there is an open SLG (aka ticket) with Epic on this issue
2) I will contact the person who is familiar with this report and get some answeres for him (the client).

Hi Mario,

The only other person that I know that had access to it was Vickie Spradlin and she called me yesterday letting me know she no longer had access either.

It's a report that shows refunds that the site has requested. It allowed Vickie and I to accept or reject their refund requests.

Hi Mario,

I'm not sure what the pathway is because I haven't used it in over a year since my Credit Balance days.  I've contacted someone in Credit Balances and she thinks that it should've been located below, she doesn't have it anymore either.

Epic>Enterprise Billing>Professional Billing.

I hope this helps!

This has happened to me once before and Rachael Cook at TSG helped me with it.

Thanks!

Hello Mark,

I have received your request to have Sectra default to opening to the current exam instead of the oldest.  Unfortunately that is a system setting that will have to be changed for all users and unable to be change for only one user.  I have put this optimization request in with Sectra to see if this can be set in future versions.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

This is Gaynell Krista, and I work in the Administration Suite on 2nd floor of the ION building.  I don't know about anyone else, but the three secretaries who work in the Admin Suite that of whom I am aware this is affecting are myself, Jenny Burton and Meredith McDowell.  This started this afternoon, as I was working in a file in the S:drive.  The document faded out (best way to describe), and then I was unable to save the file, type in the file or keep working in that file.  Then a few minutes later, I heard Meredith mention to Jenny that she was having problems, and then Jenny said she was as well.

So I have shut everything down and restarted, and now I cannot work in the P:drive or the S:drive.  I need to report this, because I have a lot of work to accomplish this afternoon and really need to have those drives up and running.

Description of Issue: unable to access virtual machine through citrix from home.

Can login into apps site- when they click on the desktop it states that citrix is installing when it is already installed or another instance is running and it will shut down now. Have checked connection settings- no connects found, Rebooted computer, deleted and re-installed citrix. cleared browsing history (IE11) Tried chrome, edge and IE11 still with same results.""

Issue was originally worked in ticket SD878723.
Troubleshooting states ""Client was accessing the Portal through Chrome, & it was giving him an error that he needed IE10 or higher to run Report Exec.
Had him launch Portal in IE. When he tries to launch applications there, it asks him if he wants to open or save the ica file. He selects open & it then asks him what program he wants to open it with. He selects Citrix Receiver, & then he gets an error that ""Citrix Receiver is already installed so its going to cancel the installation"". The box then closes & the application doesn't launch.
Had him verify that ica files are associated with Citrix Receiver, so it should just launch directly through Citrix Receiver.""

Hi

Usually the 49 error on the printer is a bad print job from a PC to the printer. The fix is to find the pc and delete the job from the printer.
Is there another printer everyone can print to?

I was working in SUP to test out the manual SIA adjustments that I have to do and wanted to make sure they worked and flowed to the correct gl.  When I looked at the detail tx for Roanoke, Franklin and NRV I saw a difference in NRV and Franklin.  I sent an email to Barbara Johnson our NRV accountant to verify which GL is correct.  Her answer is below.

Barbara,  Good morning.  Hope you are well.  If I give you two gl can you please confirm which ones are correct?  These are contractuals.  I noticed a different and before we use them I want to make sure TSG mapped the GL account correctly.  Thank you for any help you can give me.

030016157410002  15 digits

Laura:
The 14 digit number is correct.
Thanks,

Barb

We need this fixed for NRV and Franklin.
NRV HO SIA OFFSET ADJUSTMENT is mapped to GL 030016157410002  in EPIC
NRV HO SIA OFFSET ADJUSTMENT needs to be mapped to GL 03016157410002

Franklin HO SIA OFFSET ADJUSTMENT is mapped to GL 050016574100002 in EPIC
Franklin HO SIA OFFSET ADJUSTMENT needs to be  mapped to GL 05016157410002

I can not make any SIA offset adjustments until this is resolved.  The adjustment has to flow to the correct GL.

I called and spoke with Kelly, I veriied that all was correct in the SER. Kelly told me that it was insurance plans who called and said the NPI  informaiton was incorrect. I suggested that she contact Kristen Wyrick with Provider Enrolllment to ensure all information with the plans were correct. Morevoer, that Dr. Harris' NPI registry page is updated from Resident to full provider.  I think the latter is the real issue.

I told Kellyi that we would hold her ticket open until we heard back from her or Kristen.

Sending this ticket to Physician Training to have them walk Dr. Collier through addending his attestation to reflect the date of 7/3/17 omstead of 7/4/17 on the DoD related Progress note that was filed at 12:32 on 7/5/17.

Email communication from Dr. Collier and Tina Bradshaw.
""Dr. Collier said he was present on 7/3 - he can't get the note corrected on his Attestation of the resident notes.
Thanks

Per Dr.Collier:



Collier, Bryan R, DO  Bradshaw, Tina D, MOA



     You are right. I was present on July 3. All events happened prior to midnight. I am not sure how to change in the chart at this point.""

I then sent the below email back to Tina and Julie.

""Hey Tina and Julie,

He won’t be able to change what the other provider wrote in his note..but Dr. Collier can addend his attestation on that note. I logged in as him in SUP and it’s fairly simple.

Based on his communication, I don’t need to change anything that was requested in Julie’s ticket, correct?

Ticket information:
“Issue reported by user:
Date of death needs to be changed from 7/3/17 to 7/4/17.

Per Dr Collier who was in room at time of death:
Incorrect Time of Death: 7/3/17 at 2349
Correct Time of Death: 7/4/17 at 0023”


I can send this ticket to a physician trainer who can reach out to Dr. Collier to help him addend his attestation if he wants to change his verbiage from 7/4 to 7/3, once I have confirmation from you all no action needs to be taken from a technology perspective.


Thanks.""
08/02/17 11:14:43 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Received communication from Julie and billing folks below that Dr. Collier wants to ""edit"" the note because the DoD is actually 7/4/17. See my below email coorespondence with HIM and Billing.

""Hey team,

This one is a little tricky because Dr. Collier did not write the note. He co-signed another physician’s note (Dr. Rosenblat) with this Attestation “I was present with the resident on July 4 for the history, exam, and medical decision making when they were involved. I discussed the case and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note and what is listed above.” In which Dr. Rosenblat stated the ToD was 23:49 on 7/3/17.

Also there are flowsheets that stop recording the patient’s vitals at 23:49 on 7/3/17 recorded by a different individual (Valerie Davis RN. These flowsheets indicate 0 pulse at 23:49 on 7/3/17.

Also there was a code blue initiated at 23:20 by Valerie Davis RN in which the code blue ended at 23:49 on 7/3/17 with a pulse of 0.

From a technology perspective we can help “correct” anything that needs to be corrected, but based on the information that is in EPIC by multiple folks I don’t feel very confident in making the changes / helping the provider with the changes being asked for.

From an operational perspective who can analyze this and make the decision of what the DoD should be? There are multiple pieces of clinical data currently supporting 7/3/17 23:49 but Dr. Collier is communicating with Billing operational folks that the date needs to be 7/4/17.

Dr. Collier did get back to me and feels the DOS should be 7/3/17.    He can not addend his note to reflect 7/3 vs 7/4/17.   Can someone call him or get with him on how to addend his note ?

Kari Spradlin sent me the below email ""Yes, this is one that the Analyst sent to have me review and change.

The resident documented a death pronouncement note filed on 7/4/17 1:47 pm (note started on 7/4 at 12:30 am), stating the time of death was called at 11:49 pm. This would be a late entry note due to death occurring so close to midnight. This note is co-signed by Dr. Collier. The death record in the flow sheets also states TOD as 2349 on 7/3/17. On the vital signs flow sheet the vitals ended at 2349 on 7/3 and show a pulse of 0. Also, no other events took place after that time.

I don't see any information in the documentation that we normally look at to determine date/time of death to support that Dr. Collier was in the room on 7/4 at 0023 and/or pronounced death at that time.

Based on the information I reviewed in the record, I feel that 7/3/17 @ 2349 is the correct discharge date/time of death for this record. ""


In which I then emailed Julie Jones
""Hey Julie,

I received your helpdesk ticket and did a little research in EPIC. Upon doing research I noticed Kari Spradlin had abstracted the chart from an HIM perspective and changed the discharge and associated DoD with that information. She said that she found “The resident documented a death pronouncement note filed on 7/4/17 1:47 pm (note started on 7/4 at 12:30 am), stating the time of death was called at 11:49 pm 7/3/17. This would be a late entry note due to death occurring so close to midnight. This note is co-signed by Dr. Collier. The death record in the flow sheets also states TOD as 2349 on 7/3/17. On the vital signs flow sheet the vitals ended at 2349 on 7/3 and show a pulse of 0. Also, no other events took place after that time.”

HIM believes the appropriate DoD is 7/3/17 @ 23:49 due to their abstracting process. Did you find any documentation in EPIC from Dr. Collier that would support the DoD being changed to 7/4/17? The screenshots attached to the helpdesk ticket you submitted were of a workqueue and I did not see any clinical information in them with Dr. Collier saying the DoD was on 7/4/17.

I’d be glad to chat with you over the phone about this if you’d like.

540-293-0179""
07/31/17 20:29:07 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Spoke with Allison before receiving the ticket.
I then researched the patient in question.
With that information I sent the below email to Kari Spradlin (HIM Supervisor RMH) for help.
Hey Kari,

I received a helpdesk ticket from Julie at CASB in billing wanting to change the date of death time on a patient. I see in Event Management on the patient you had changed the discharge date on this patient from 7/4/17 early to 7/3/17 late. I imagine you were doing abstracting and noticed documentation that indicated to do so. Can you tell me what you were looking at when you made that change? In he helpJulie says Dr. Collier was in the room at the time of death and it was 7/4/17 0023, but a clinical RN was the person who initially made the DoD on 7/3/17.

Any thoughts on the appropriate date of death from your perspective?

Charlotte Dunlap calling back into the TSC at 540-354-4228 regarding this ticket.  This user is still having this issue.  Please see attached screenshot and instructions.  This user does not have any dashboards for one to see the instructions, and this user does not have this option to do precharting.  This is unavilable to her, and she needs it.

See attached screenshots of odd issues.

I remoted in and it is activing like it is opening a generic profile.  It is mapping out to her network drives but has none of her desktop items.  It also has a boot time for 2014.  I had user resart and log back in but still not correct. I went under users folder and it has her proper profile.  I checked programs list and nothing is showing incorrectly there.  We went ahead and started virus scan and are going to let it run. We will follow up when its done.","","GREGORIEFF, CHYREL S.","TRGILES","MSJORDAN","08/30/17 13:30:22","08/30/17 13:30:22 US/Eastern (xMatters):

Chyrel S. Gregorieff calling back into the TSC at 540-985-8272 to reopen this ticket.  She is reporting that her computer is all messed up after this ticket was closed.  It appears/user thinks that her computer may have been reimaged?  She is still getting the same exact citrix error that is now attached.  All of her bookmarks in firefox are now gone, and she wants them back.  She is unable to use this computer for the most part.  This looks like the complete wrong image.  Her wallpaper is not even loading correct picture or the correct resolution.  I have never seen a Carilion computer look this far off what it should.
