This incident is related to a chart correction that needs coding to make corrections before this can be resolved.  Is there someone that can address the changes needed?

I believe Elaine Montgomery was the one making the request.  Below is what is in the incident, I am not sure if this provides you the details needed, or if you need more information.  If so, can you check back with Elaine?

Hey chart correction team,

A new chart was created for a patient when in reality it was the patient's brother who received services during the 1/16-1/18 service dates.

Sue Patrick has gone ahead and merged the two charts, but there is remaining data within NOTES and two letters (consent to Operate written by MD and Carilion Direct letter from an RN) that reference the incorrect patient by name or age.

Please review all notes and letters that were written on the 1/16-1/18 encounter and have client's correct their notes to reflect the correct patient's name: Jason Nathaniel Hill (49y.o.) (11/22/1967)

CHART CORRECTION - I was contacted by Legal who is working on Guardianship/Conservator paperwork for this patient and his date of birth and last name are incorrect. Also, documentation in his chart refers to him as a 60 year old male when he is actually over 70 years of age. Following is the email I received:

  ""I'm working on a guardian/conservator petition for a patient at CRMH, and the record has an incorrect birth date, which the patient has acknowledged is incorrect.  The social worker contacted Patient Access to request a change of the birth date but was told that change cannot occur until the patient is discharged.  The problem is that, in multiple progress notes, the physicians are referring to the patient as a ""60-year old male,"" when he is actually over 70 years old.  The patient's MRN is 998939, last name is Berrman; however, the medical record appears to still refer to him as Berriom.  Long story short, this patient has utilized multiple aliases, but his social worker Brittany has received confirmation of legal name and birth date from Social Security and the VA.  You likely want to reach out to Brittany to get additional information on this patient issue.""   I have reached out to Legal and asked for Brittany's last name and phone number.

Hello Sam,

Ok, what I found out about not being able to add Dr. Unwin as a PCP.
A committee of providers got together and decided what type of providers should be allowed to be a PCP for a patient. It was decided the specialty of Geriatrics should not be included. Therefore any provider with a specialty of Geriatrics cannot be a PCP for a patient.

Dr. Speaker, one of the providers in that group said they would re-review this if a case is made for a Geriatric provider to be marked as a PCP.

Do you want to reply with the reasons why we need Dr. Unwin to be the PCP and I will take it up with them and try and get this reversed?

Let me know.

Thanks.
07/18/17 10:55:33 US/Eastern (DLCAMERON):
David,
This provider has a specialty type of Geriatric Medicine.  With the 2015 upgrade we moved to using the provider’s specialty in an extension to determine who could be listed as a PCP.  Dr. Speaker approved the list of specialties for us, but Geriatric Medicine was not one of them, so that is why this provider can’t be chosen as a PCP.  I think we would need his approval to update the LPP which would allow this provider to be chosen.  Let us know if this helps.

Subject: question

I have an issue I can’t figure out, and I wonder if you might have some guidance. A nurse is trying to add Dr. Brian Unwin, specialty of Geriatrics,  as a PCP on a patient. She is unable too. She is able to add this provider to the Care Team, but not as a PCP.

The SER team reports the SER is ok
The Cadence team says the patient is not dismissed or anything like that.
The only thing I see in common is we cannot add other providers from the same specialty as a PCP either.
The nurse is able to add other providers as a PCP so I don’t think it is an access issue.

Thoughts?

Thanks.

Client called me back. She is trying to add Dr. Brian Unwin as a PCP. This provider can not be added as a PCP. He can be added to the care team, but just not as a PCP.
Client is able to add other providers as PCPs. It does not seem to be her access.
Going to ask the SER team if there is a setting in the ser to allow PCP.

Hello Sam,
I see in the chart the PCP is still blank. Who are you trying to add? They might be an external provider that does not have a record in Epic.

I tried calling you at the the number they gave me, 540-526-1160 but it seemed to be the wrong number.

Thanks.

Connected Rose Hurd and Savorn Kong through a conference call to talk about the error. Savorn made the request to have Rose use Kronos through direct link instead of using the Citrix icon. She is able to do this by opening Firefox and typing kronos.carilion.com in the address bar. He would like for her to try this for a week to see if she still gets the error. She has agreed to do this.

I will also contact the Staffing Office and ask them to do the same thing. I have sent an email to Kathy Ott and attached a reminder notice to be hung up next to the staffing computer. The attachment I sent is on the attachment tab and the email is pasted below:

Subject: Kronos - 2 Items

Kathy,

I have 2 items for you – 1 is a request for the Staffing Office, the other is for your review:

1.	When Kevin and I were there last week to meet with Brandie & you, we were talking to Karen Reese while she was doing some staffing. She casually mentioned an error that she has been seeing pop up recently that we thought had disappeared. It happens to be the same error that Rose Hurd has reported. Until Karen said something, we thought just Rose was getting it because no one else had reported it. The error doesn’t keep the user from doing anything or information from saving, it’s mainly an annoyance, but still needs to be fixed. We are working with Kronos to solve. I was on the phone with Rose and a Kronos support person this morning and he would like to see if this error is related to the version of Citrix we are currently running. To test this we are asking Rose to not use the Kronos icon on the desktop, but instead open Firefox and type Kronos.carilion.com to get to Kronos. Will you also ask the Staffing Office to do this? We would like for them to try this for a week to see if going around the Citrix server gets rid of the error. I’ve attached a note that can be posted in the staffing workspace as a reminder for them. We would like to get a report of results at the end of next week. Doesn’t have to be detailed – just “didn’t see the error at all today” or “still had the error 2 times”, etc. The error we are looking for is NGUI – 00090 and will come up in a box with a pink header.

Subject: Update on Kronos issues

Rose,

I just wanted to follow up with you about your open tickets with us about issues in Kronos.

Kevin may have already followed up with you – but he has opened a case with Kronos Global Support (KGS) about the names & schedules not lining up. Kronos requested a copy of our test environment database so that they could attempt to reproduce the problem themselves and try to find a solution. We were able to get that to them yesterday. You are not the only user to report this scrolling issue.

I opened a case with KGS about the NGUI-00090 error that you are receiving. They will also be using the copy of our database to see if they can get that error message to show up for them. We also sent a copy of the database logs that show the error during the time that you received it. This will help them research if there was something else going on in the system at the same time. We still have not received any other reports of other users having received this error message. Do you know of anyone else who has seen this message pop up? Are you still getting this error on a regular basis?

We will let you know when we get any further updates from Kronos about these issues.

Thanks!

Beth

Javon added the workflow tracer to the device in the ticket & uploaded some files to the Epic SLG 3340846 on 8/4. These files didn’t reveal the needed information so we asked the doctor to continue to use the tracer. I have been on vacation & have not heard anything from the provider. I cannot reach him to ask if he has had the error recur & clicked the workflow tracer.

Would you be able to check & see if there are any additional log files on this device & if so, post them to the above SLG? Thanks

Email communication from Dr. Collier and Tina Bradshaw.
""Dr. Collier said he was present on 7/3 - he can't get the note corrected on his Attestation of the resident notes.
Thanks

Per Dr.Collier:



Collier, Bryan R, DO  Bradshaw, Tina D, MOA



     You are right. I was present on July 3. All events happened prior to midnight. I am not sure how to change in the chart at this point.""

I then sent the below email back to Tina and Julie.

""Hey Tina and Julie,

He won’t be able to change what the other provider wrote in his note..but Dr. Collier can addend his attestation on that note. I logged in as him in SUP and it’s fairly simple.

Based on his communication, I don’t need to change anything that was requested in Julie’s ticket, correct?

Ticket information:
“Issue reported by user:
Date of death needs to be changed from 7/3/17 to 7/4/17.

Per Dr Collier who was in room at time of death:
Incorrect Time of Death: 7/3/17 at 2349
Correct Time of Death: 7/4/17 at 0023”


I can send this ticket to a physician trainer who can reach out to Dr. Collier to help him addend his attestation if he wants to change his verbiage from 7/4 to 7/3, once I have confirmation from you all no action needs to be taken from a technology perspective.


Thanks.""
08/02/17 11:14:43 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Received communication from Julie and billing folks below that Dr. Collier wants to ""edit"" the note because the DoD is actually 7/4/17. See my below email coorespondence with HIM and Billing.

""Hey team,

This one is a little tricky because Dr. Collier did not write the note. He co-signed another physician’s note (Dr. Rosenblat) with this Attestation “I was present with the resident on July 4 for the history, exam, and medical decision making when they were involved. I discussed the case and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note and what is listed above.” In which Dr. Rosenblat stated the ToD was 23:49 on 7/3/17.

Also there are flowsheets that stop recording the patient’s vitals at 23:49 on 7/3/17 recorded by a different individual (Valerie Davis RN. These flowsheets indicate 0 pulse at 23:49 on 7/3/17.

Also there was a code blue initiated at 23:20 by Valerie Davis RN in which the code blue ended at 23:49 on 7/3/17 with a pulse of 0.

From a technology perspective we can help “correct” anything that needs to be corrected, but based on the information that is in EPIC by multiple folks I don’t feel very confident in making the changes / helping the provider with the changes being asked for.

From an operational perspective who can analyze this and make the decision of what the DoD should be? There are multiple pieces of clinical data currently supporting 7/3/17 23:49 but Dr. Collier is communicating with Billing operational folks that the date needs to be 7/4/17.

Dr. Collier did get back to me and feels the DOS should be 7/3/17.    He can not addend his note to reflect 7/3 vs 7/4/17.   Can someone call him or get with him on how to addend his note ?

Kari Spradlin sent me the below email ""Yes, this is one that the Analyst sent to have me review and change.

The resident documented a death pronouncement note filed on 7/4/17 1:47 pm (note started on 7/4 at 12:30 am), stating the time of death was called at 11:49 pm. This would be a late entry note due to death occurring so close to midnight. This note is co-signed by Dr. Collier. The death record in the flow sheets also states TOD as 2349 on 7/3/17. On the vital signs flow sheet the vitals ended at 2349 on 7/3 and show a pulse of 0. Also, no other events took place after that time.

I don't see any information in the documentation that we normally look at to determine date/time of death to support that Dr. Collier was in the room on 7/4 at 0023 and/or pronounced death at that time.

Based on the information I reviewed in the record, I feel that 7/3/17 @ 2349 is the correct discharge date/time of death for this record. ""


In which I then emailed Julie Jones
""Hey Julie,

I received your helpdesk ticket and did a little research in EPIC. Upon doing research I noticed Kari Spradlin had abstracted the chart from an HIM perspective and changed the discharge and associated DoD with that information. She said that she found “The resident documented a death pronouncement note filed on 7/4/17 1:47 pm (note started on 7/4 at 12:30 am), stating the time of death was called at 11:49 pm 7/3/17.

On the vital signs flow sheet the vitals ended at 2349 on 7/3 and show a pulse of 0. Also, no other events took place after that time.”

HIM believes the appropriate DoD is 7/3/17 @ 23:49 due to their abstracting process. Did you find any documentation in EPIC from Dr. Collier that would support the DoD being changed to 7/4/17? The screenshots attached to the helpdesk ticket you submitted were of a workqueue and I did not see any clinical information in them with Dr. Collier saying the DoD was on 7/4/17.

I’d be glad to chat with you over the phone about this if you’d like.

540-293-0179""
07/31/17 20:29:07 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Spoke with Allison before receiving the ticket.
I then researched the patient in question.
With that information I sent the below email to Kari Spradlin (HIM Supervisor RMH) for help.
Hey Kari,

I received a helpdesk ticket from Julie at CASB in billing wanting to change the date of death time on a patient. I see in Event Management on the patient you had changed the discharge date on this patient from 7/4/17 early to 7/3/17 late. I imagine you were doing abstracting and noticed documentation that indicated to do so. Can you tell me what you were looking at when you made that change? In he helpJulie says Dr. Collier was in the room at the time of death and it was 7/4/17 0023, but a clinical RN was the person who initially made the DoD on 7/3/17.

Any thoughts on the appropriate date of death from your perspective?

FYI---886 and 885 discharges have been canceled.  So I have put in new discharge dates.   Figured you would need to know to notify TSG of this so they will know the dates are in there because I replaced them today.

Spoke to client and he advised that the vendor has suggested the issue is with the version of Firefox that is being used. Our standard for Firefox is the ESR version and we are usually no more than 1 version behind and this is only for a short time. Advised client to verify the Firefox version and we can test that version for functionality verification. CLient will verify Firefox version with vendor and let me know so that we can install that version for testing.

I'm looking at the the servers now and she has a profile on two out of the five servers.  They look a bit old.  I've deleted them in case that's the issue.  I don't see an issue with the servers and we've currently 42 sessions pretty much evenly distributed across all five servers.

Looked at her AD account and she should be fine for access to the application.  Here AD account is in all the groups needed.  Added it specifically to the app to be sure.

Since she's able to connect to other apps I don't think there's a overall SSL issue here.  If that was the case we'd have a lot more tickets from across multiple applications.

I logged onto the apps portal and was able to launch the Clintrac application to the logon screen successfully.

Ask her if she's entering her user name in caps.  I've seen an issue with a specific alpha combination in the past if it was entered in caps but this combination isn't in her user name.  Just a thought.  Recommend that she try it in lower case if she's not.

I'm out of the office today resting up for tonight's Epic2017 go live.  Hope this helps.

Sorry Kevin,

I spoke with her last night and was not able to reach her today.  I will try again in a bit and verify your questions with her.

Anything else I should ask her while I am speaking with her?

Does the error state SSL Error 34 or just Error 34 and has she been able to connect successfully in the past?  Is this new behavior today?

Hi Kevin,

I have a ticket IM396300 where the person is having trouble accessing Clintrac via the apps portal.

The ticket states, "" Vendor is unable to open Clintrac from the apps portal.
I spent time with the user uninstalling and reinstalling the correct Citrix version, we verified that she can open Epic with no issues but when she tries to open Clintrac the application will not open fully and allow her to log in (window closes out).

We Added Citrix_Softmed AD Group

I spoke with Amber Sterling.  After she signs into portal (apps site) she gets the citrix desktop.  She clicks the clintrac icon and it says connecting, then starting and it hangs.  Client has tried with Chrome and IE.

I had her install firefox and test.  Firefox throws: Unable to connect to the Citrix XEN App.   Server.fsl error 34.  She has tried in Chrome IE, & Firefox.    She is able to access Epic, the Citirx Desktop etc.

She can sign into the Citrix Desktop (other icons launch, such as Epic and the Carilion Desktop) when she clicks the Clintrac icon that is when she gets the error.  The 1st login box never loads.

I let Stephanie Johnson know who stated, “Hmmm, I have asked Lonnie and Kevin and we have no idea.  That's new to us.  Maybe Kevin Zeitz would have some idea.”

Is this something you can assist with?

Ticket is IM396300 – AD ASTERLING

Please let me know if you have questions or need anything.

Okay, this doesn't sound like a Clintrac issue to me.  Sounds more like something from a server perspective maybe?  I tried to call her and also did not get her.  I want to make sure that she is logging into the first Windows screen with her AD account and password and then does she even get the 3M login or is she not even getting to that second login.

Hi Stephanie,

Her access was setup 3/13/17 by LFPHILLIPS (task T143970).  I’m not sure if she has been able to sign in before.  I attempted to reach the client but she didn’t answer this morning.  We tested the access in Firefox as she it was just hanging in Chrome and IE, although she is able to access epic in all three via apps.carilionclinic.org.

Firefox throws the error: Unable to connect to the Citrix XEN App.   Server.fsl error 34.

Hi Polly,
For the ticket reference above, we are not really sure what your question is and exactly what you want us to research:

Epic:
HAR's for same patient have been returned from SCA for CFAP adj and now have a remaining balance and a BI of 1134.  Corrected balances have not returned to SCA.  (104965863, 104981258, 1006970503,104986123)

 The only HAR at SCA is 104984960-Kristy Thomas which was over there at the original balance BEFORE the CFAP adj was taken off.  I have asked SCA to adj the balance on their side to reconcile with Epic on this HAR.

Epic ID: PHSUTPHIN

You have an acct note on the HAR 104984960 that states:
C. Carroll from PPS emailed about this HAR.  SCA had it on their side for full
amount before CFAP Adj.  Looks like timing issue all happening on 7/20 and at
the time we were in process of changing over to different statement levels of
1-5.  Requested they adj SCA side to reconcile with Epic balance of 151.41.  So
many processes have changed no way to go back on one example to determine
anything other than timing when fired.

Connie stated in her note that the acct went to SCA on 7/28, but it did not:
Reviewed for S. Justice with sca this account loaded on sca system 07/28/2017
with a balance of $378.53, Epich has the balance also showing the paritial adj
that was done on 07/20/2017 leaving $151.41.  Not sure how ended up on sca
system with a $378.53 balance  07/28/2017 .  Emailed Polly S to review.

Please advise on what your question is.

This account was NOT sent to SCA on 7/28/17.  It was returned from SCA on 7/20/17 and sent to PPS.

Hi Kevin,

As we just discussed on the phone about the credentialing issue you are having in 3.14.31, I can have a Support representative reach out on Wednesday when you are free to assist with the cred counts utility/cred fix utility.

Regarding the ""Error opening connection to Data Bank server, check Internet"" NPDB error, here is some more information that will help you and the rest of your IT team with ensuring all settings are good to go on your side with the NPDB using Visual CACTUS 3.14.31.

First, if any host files are used on local computers or servers, the new NPDB address will need to be mapped. The new address is http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/ with an IP address of 54.186.167.170 on port 443. Unfortunately, the NPDB has lingering issues with migrating all its old addresses, or alternatively, forwarding old DNS addresses to its new location. For example, http://npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov/ is no longer valid, but http://www.npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov correctly forwards to http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/. To connect, you will want to ensure host files, routing, and firewalls at all levels account for these changes.

Also, you will want to verify that the end users are running Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher on their workstations. The easiest way to verify this is to go to the registry on the workstation and verify the build. You will want to go to
Start > Run > regedit.exe, then navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full.

=========================
Hi Kevin and Stacy,


There is a process within Cactus that queries a National Provider database (NPDB).  This query has not been working for awhile and the clients desire to resume this functionality.


Please review the questions below presented by our Cactus support representative.  Time can be logged to IM396380.

Hi Kevin,

As we just discussed on the phone about the credentialing issue you are having in 3.14.31, I can have a Support representative reach out on Wednesday when you are free to assist with the cred counts utility/cred fix utility.

Regarding the ""Error opening connection to Data Bank server, check Internet"" NPDB error, here is some more information that will help you and the rest of your IT team with ensuring all settings are good to go on your side with the NPDB using Visual CACTUS 3.14.31.

(for Kevin - do these need to be added on the cacti-prd-db02 server?)
First, if any host files are used on local computers or servers, the new NPDB address will need to be mapped. The new address is http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/ with an IP address of 54.186.167.170 on port 443. Unfortunately, the NPDB has lingering issues with migrating all its old addresses, or alternatively, forwarding old DNS addresses to its new location. For example, http://npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov/ is no longer valid, but http://www.npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov correctly forwards to http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/. To connect, you will want to ensure host files, routing, and firewalls at all levels account for these changes.

Kevin,

Is Clarissa Lovegrove's ticket related to the connectivity problems we've had in ClinTrac since the CRS update on Sept 8?  PM10791

She ""can partially open ClinTrac. It won't let her work within ClinTrac. This is an ongoing problem.
She can open it to see the patient lists, but cannot work on the application. User is in Firefox. ""

The ticket is in the ""Pending Customer"" status. Are you expecting a response from her?

Does ""partially open ClinTrac"" mean that she can look up an acct but she can't launch CRS/CAC? Is she getting the ""codefind executable"" error or does ClinTrac turn gray/unresponsive after CRS opens and she clicks ""continue"" to try to open CAC?

Thanks,
Rebecca

Hi Laura,

Thank you for taking a look at this ticket. I saw your update but I’m still a little unclear how it was determined this was entered manually?  I ran a charge router reconciliation report and it appears this charge was  entered three times.  I highlighted the last one that was in question by the caller, in the Technical Section it shows that the charge is associated with Order 305850876.  Am I missing something?

Sorry for resending that, I didn't notice the comments prior.

I called Karen back.  I do not see any encounters or orders associated with that charge.  It appeared to be entered manually, and i told her so.  I could see in the wq when it was entered.  She was wondering how one would do this.  She seemed okay with deleting this charge, but i wasn't sure if your team could verify that this was the case.

let me know if you need anything else.

When they converted it and completed it, did they follow the correct workflow to get it to trigger correctly?  Based on the ticket, this wasn’t performed at Blue Ridge Family practice, so we need to know if the providers missed a step or did something incorrectly that caused the charge to post as though it did.  We want to make sure they are following the proper workflow that will post the charge under the correct DEP and provider.

Hi Teresa,

I’m researching ticket IM397035. Can you tell me if order 305850876 was done correctly? I’m trying to determine if the intent was to trigger a charge or was it supposed to be a referral.

We share this calendar with Planning and Community Development, (Shirley Hollands group), and they were not converted to Windows 10/Office 365. When we (MarCom) were converted initially, the conference room reservation calendar was not converted, so no one was able to schedule the conference room. I called and worked with David Huggett to remedy the situation. He upgraded the calendar, which worked for MarCom, but knocked PCD off the calendar. We went back and forth trying different solutions, and thought we had it taken care of  the admins for both departments were able to go into the calendar and reserve the conference room, and I thought the rest of the people in both departments had the same ability.

I received the attached emails from Kristin Goddard, so Im guessing that there is still an issue. I spoke with Kristin and this was not a case of operator error; she used the steps she would normally use in order to reserve the conference room. Also, although the room was available at the time Kristin wanted to reserve it yesterday, her appointment did not show up, and I did not get a confirmation that the room reservation was accepted by the room (as I would normally). She did finally receive a decline notice, on Sunday, long after the request was submitted (see 2nd email attachment).

We really need to correct this issue. This is our only conference room and it stays very busy with reservations. I am very concerned that the room will be double-booked if reservations are not showing up when people send the room request.

Received the following email from Brenda:

Hi Clyde,

I wanted to give you another piece of information regarding our shared conference room calendar. It seems that if someone tries to schedule the room and there is a conflict, rather than the room declining the meeting it is plugging it into the calendar as a “tentative” meeting. The meeting organizer (nor the three calendar owners) get a notification that there is a tentative meeting request. So it is giving the meeting requestors (along with the three calendar owners) a false sense of the meeting being approved, since there is no notification whatsoever.

Side note, when I declined one of the meetings that came in as tentative due to a conflict, I received the attached email. Both Peggy and Michele are part of the Planning dept. which was not converted to Windows 10/Office 365.

Keep me posted on the progress with Microsoft. Have a great weekend!

This patient's office visit from 7-3-17 is hitting our Closed Encounter report.  It does not need a co-signature.  The visit is 42 days old.  The encounter was billed with H0005 which is a code that can only be used with Medicaid.  This patient has Medicare insurance so the correct cpt code should be 90853 for group psychotherapy.  This charge seems to be stuck in the Client Bill (Labs) work queue.  Can you please change the cpt code for this visit to 90853 and remove it from the Client Bill (Labs) workqueue?

I looked at the PB account in question 805538365, this patient has two different Guarantor Accounts, one is Auto and the other is P/F. The other coverages for the patient do not appear because this HAR is attached to the Auto Guarantor which only has Generic Auto attached to it. The patients P/F account has the Medicaid coverage attached to it. This has been the behavior all along. I pulled up version 2015 and looked up this account and only the Auto appears as well. Sending this to the training team to contact the user and explain.

This is expanding to more than just the orders only, below is a pt note on a no show when I called the client they advised that if the person no shows 2 times they can charge the patient therefore they have to be able to note this in the chart so when they do this now it is not letting them close the encounter after they put the charges in and the note for why charges were put in.

Thank you for the examples. The charge sessions are splitting because the Service Providers are different.  See example below.  All information must match for the charges to be included in one charge session. This does not affect claims. The charges will be pulled back together during claim run.

I like your idea.  If you find that certain S codes are coming up as common overrides, we can code around those if that makes sense. One suggestion - We could make these still go to wq 1362 but take away the override and instead they transfer to a new HB wq.  That way they can fix their mistakes without you having to look at them first.

Hi Cyndi,
Angie and I reviewed this ticket and I am now working on it.  So we are in somewhat of a corner, i.e., occurrence code 11 didn't get automatically added because of the ""S"" code and then the PAS user overrode the claim edit so we end up with no S code.  Here are next steps:
1) The S code on this claim is S81.801S Unspecified open wound, right lower leg, sequela.  Is that one of the S codes that is excluded from needing an accident code?  After talking with Epic, if we can get the list of S codes that do not indicate accident we may be able to improve the automated logic for adding 11 by excluding these S codes.  In the past you have stated there are a lot of exceptions.  Is it possible to pull together this list and send it over?
2) As a short-term fix, I can add a claim edit when there is no occurrence code 01-06 or 11.  This would probably need to be worked by HB.  I don't think we want to go the route of PAS updating the claim directly, at least not right now.
3) What were you doing before PAS had the override?
thanks,
Barbara

Reviewed examples.  I unbilled and re-billed one of them in SUP to verify the Occ Code 11 was missing before any edits were made to the claim and it was.  I did get the claim edit that client mentions regarding the accident Dx.
Reviewed the CDF for Medicare and see the logic for Occ Code.  For OC 11 - Onset of Symptoms/Illness, there are two lines in the table using rules 740897 & 740898.
740897 - CC HB 11 Dx Not Accident
74098 - CC HB 11 Pt Recurring

The claims for these two examples do not meet either of these rules to automatically get OC 11.  Will need to f/u with co-worker to verify that this is the only logic that controls Occ Code.  I could not find anything in the HSD.

David responded with below. Checking into the encryption rule for JCHS machines.

Stuart,

Good afternoon. I have not done anything to the drive. All I do is plug it into my computer and copy files from it and to it. I do not believe it is encrypted. Mark told me that in the past he had been prompted to encrypt it, but he always canceled that. I think the problem lies on his machine. JCHS faculty are supposed to have the device encryption DISABLED on their devices, but his device still seems to have it enabled. At least, that’s my best guess.

I have already forwarded them to the resident and Regina.
One was gonorrhea/chlamydia result
The other was HPV co-testing (the PAP was still pending).

Another one is now in my inbasket - MR#7598284  TW - PAP smear performed by Dr. Patel.  Looks like it is the one that I had just the HPV testing this morning and I can see I routed it to Regina and Patel.  But now the cytology portion is back so it dumped into my inbasket.

Good afternoon,

Since the upgrade, I have received questions about linking a research patient encounter in EPIC. It appears that if you go through the patient station screen, you can double click and amend a previous encounter to link it to research, but the feature has gone away to link future encounters. Is there another way to link a future research encounter to the research account?

Thank you,

There is a known issue of some Barco monitors failing the Visual Test in MediCal QA.  According to Barco, a recent security update from Microsoft has affected Java functionality, which is preventing all test patterns (including the SMPTE test pattern used for the Visual Test) from being displayed.  I am looking into a workaround, and will let you know what I find.

Right now, we know that one device at Giles and one device at Stonewall have been affected.  If any other fail QC, please let me know.

I created a referral in POC and attached a appointment to the referral and changed the scheduling status to ""Call X1"" and ran the referral end of day batch and the cadence end of day batch. After running the batch, the scheduling status did not change from ""Call X1"". I removed all the scheduling status's from the table except for ""Not Scheduled"". I also tested some referrals with canceled and rescheduled appointments and it still didn't flip. Christina P. created some test referrals and I ran the end of day again and they stayed the same.

I looked at the examples provided and it looks like the staff are scheduling the appointments before calling the patients. When they attempt to call the patient and are unsuccessful, they are changing the Scheduled status to Call X1, Call X2 or Call X3. I am not sure if they are following the right workflow so I emailed Christian Pettersen and Sonya Abdelhadi to find out if this is the right workflow. They are on vacation this week, so it might not be until next week before we get a response. I want to hear their opinion before making any changes.

Elaine and I contacted client to get more information, client explained that yesterday there were two patients on snapboard (see client's screenshot) that appears scheduled far on right, late in day around 6pm per client.  Per client she said they did not schedule these patients at those times and she could not find any audit trail to see how they got to those times.  Per client however, those clients show correct on the snapboard today, but said they did not change/adjust those appointment schedules so no explanation why they displayed incorrectly yesterday but correctly today.  Said this could be issue because they could have provided incorrect time/appointment information to client if they based on yesterday's snapboard views.

Elaine and I checked those patient's case edit trail and could not find where they were scheduled that late in the day.

I think this might have to do with an issue that we had a couple of years ago with ADT.  Will be talking to Tara when she returns from a meeting

Sometimes if an IP admission is not closed out it links together notes in the Telephone Encounter.  What will happen is when you create a new telephone note it will list every note that was done previously
Have to send to ADT to have them close the Admit
 
Here is Collen's response:
I think I found the issue here.  That patient has an admission from November of 2009 that was never closed.  It's in Endoscopy RCH, which has a setting in the profile to make encounters within 30 days of the encounter a related encounter.  The admission has never been closed, so it's relating all the encounters since that day.  The documentation section of the telephone encounters navigator only displays telephone notes, so it's only pulling in those from the ""related"" encounters.
To fix the encounters that were already linked, you'll want to close that admission and use patient station to unlink them.  You can do this by opening patient station, removing the filters on the patient, and clicking the check box next to the encounter to remove the check mark.  This unrelates the encounter.
I don't know if you'll want to change the setting or not, but it's something to consider.
I'm not sure if other patients were affected by this.  We might be able to run a search to find out, but it doesn't seem like it affects patient safety or data accuracy at all, so I don't know how critical it is.

Susan,


I called to follow up on the issue you reported, I spoke with Harriet to leave a message with you about your inquiry when documenting the History Section with the 2017 Epic Upgrade.


I discussed with a couple of our workflow analysts and was told the decision was for nurses to only document the YES history questions and that they no longer document NO.  I included the replies from our WFA - workflow analysts below.


If you have questions, I can be reached at 540-400-3857.

Joe,

Nursing is only supposed to mark yes if a question in the history section is yes.  They are NOT supposed to mark NO if the patient has no history.  If they mark no, it marks the amb provider history as “pertinent negative”.  They do n ot want to see a list of 30 pert negatives.

Karla,



I wanted to ask you a question about the history section with clients having only the ability to select YES options with new version.  In previous 2015 version they had option to select both YES and NO.



I just wanted to get more info so I can share with the client the reasons why the NO selection was removed.  I was told all they need to document now is YES and do not need to be able to document NO, but I wanted to give the client a little more info than telling her basically it is what it is, to keep from getting her upset.



Do you know the reasons surrounding the decision to remove ability to document NO in the history section(s)?   Just want to know what info to relay to client.



Thanks,

Joe

I just need some more information on what to tell the client as to why NO was removed.  She might not be too terribly happy if I just tell her YES is all you need and that's it.



Will Karla know more info on this particular subject?

I briefly spoke with Robin on Clindoc, because I checked in TST logged in as IPRN and inpatient history documentation is same way.  So she told me something about that nurses only document YES with new version now something to do with WDL for Within Defined Limits reasons, but that if I need more information to get more information from one of the Workflow Analysts.  So maybe Karla and Angie will also have more information on what I can tell the client since it appears build is supposed to be this way.

I am not sure why the no is not there. But, nursing should not be documenting no’s so I will look into this. If it changed to only yes, that is actually better J



Can you let her know we are looking into it but a no choice is not needed for nursing.

Is there a reason why the ""NO"" selections are no longer selectable?  I checked POC, TST, PRD and it is set this way in every environment, so wondering if this is the way it is supposed to be now.  I also checked old version 2015 RLB and we do have both YES and NO selections available in previous version.



Thanks,

Joe

Checked POC, TST, PRD, and SUP and all are set this way to only display YES selections.  Checked previous version RLB 2015 and previous version does have both YES and NO selections.  Checking with Dawn and Elaine if it is supposed to be this way in new version and get some info on reason why it is this way.  Checked IPRN and is also set this way for inpatient nurses.  Briefly spoke with Clindoc team member and said it is supposed to be this way, that users only chart Yes selections for WDL - Within Defined Limits, but that if I needed more explanation to speak with one of the workflow analysts.  Checking with Dawn so I can get more info to explain to client why it is set this way with new version.

1) Rad Onc:  HARs 105871849, 105876340, 105876427.  No Admit Dept since HOV-Canceled.  Talked to Kelly Tolley at Rad Onc.  She will have Mandy follow-up with me on Monday.  Also these pts have 2 recurring HARs for July.  Sent email to Michelle Crawford asking her workflow for removing the No Valid Primary Contact stop bill.
2) Radiology:  HARs 305652227 (McGuire) - in PB wq RADIOLOGY DOCUMENTATION ISSUES WQ NO RULES [78965]
105960042 (York) - in PB wq RADIOLOGY DOCUMENTATION ISSUES WQ NO RULES [78965]
After talking with Angie, sent email to Kathy K and Louise N suggesting a new wq to capture these HB HARs so they will have a home until the PB charge posts.
3) Q/E Review Coding Status, discussed with Angie and sent email to Phil:
Re. HAR 105929335 (Cornish), it has a coding status of Q/E Review - is that something you built out for Patty as part of the HAC project?  If so, do you know the workflow for where is that HAR supposed to route once it has that status?  Looking at Account History, Account WQ Activity, the system removed it from wq 1068 on 8/1 but the system never sends it back to a wq.  It is getting manually added to a wq by Chris from his review of the watch list.  (There are some in between query wqs it's hitting but those are a separate process.)
08/18/17 12:50:56 US/Eastern (AMRAMSAY):
Met with Barb to discuss the workflow for code capture when pending a PB charge.  Also looked at some of the other examples on this list and discussed options.
08/17/17 17:09:26 US/Eastern (AMRAMSAY):
Reviewed with Barbara.
08/17/17 17:00:12 US/Eastern (BABOATWRIGHT):
Hi Chris,
These depts are part of Code Capture aka Simple Visit Coding.  Rule 2840 in Code Capture looks for Total Charge (HB) from .01 to $500.  Rule 3445 in the coding wqs was looking for Account Balance (HB) to be > $500.  So I updated the coding wq rule 3445 to look for Total Charges instead of Account Balance.  This should fix the problem.   Let me know in the morning if there are still items on the watchlist with this DNB.
Thanks,
Barbara

Issue is that ZFP device is not connecting to AD correctly, causing the ZFP to reboot once hitting the ""Connecting to session"" portion during the boot phase.

Samantha Bare returned my call. She explained that user Donna Poindexter took two CC payments in the AM, then closed her drawer. Donna took a second payment at another device for 20.00 cash and closed that drawer. When she returned to the prior drawer the CC payments from the AM appeared in the cash drawer. I opened all cash drawers Peds Associates 1-5 and see that there are only devices attached to each drawer, I thought maybe Donna was listed as a user on one drawer and used a different device causing this to happen, but that was not the case. Since all drawers have been closed and reconciled I asked that the client call me back on Monday if this occurs again that way I can look at the cash drawer prior to it being closed. I will wait for a call back.
08/17/17 22:39:55 US/Eastern (CWTOLLEY):
Sounds like the USER and her DEVICE may be tied to multiple cash drawers. I will call the client and see what cash drawers she has access to and how they are set up.

Researched examples and sent info to the SE team to determine the cause of this.

Per Kevin Zeitz:  Took 3 attempts to send.  Connect time is abnormally low at 2400 kpbs when compared to all other faxes to this number.  Says it was 43 pages.  Looking at the job in ERTF Manipulator it appears to be correct number of pages.  Connect time was 3674 seconds or 61 minutes.
Think EPS got tired of waiting and timed out and reported the job failed.

Per Troy:  It is possible it was a late disconnect error that can happen even after the several pages are received and printed by the fax machine.  In 5 minutes did they receive all the pages that were expecting?  EPS times out after approximately 45 minutes even if BIscom is still trying to complete the job.  This is especially true if the ROI report is very large.


We have validated that the site received all of the pages of the release on the first try so I sent this on to SE to investigate further.

Patient is Starnes – MRN 128080.  AVS was printed at 11:28am today by Kristen Overfelt and again at 11:29am.  I don’t think this is a Lexicomp ETX.  I think it’s something we built.  We are trying to figure out which one it is.  Take a look in Chart Review.  You can see the black blob.

Troy is looking at this, too.  Not sure if it is a Lexicomp issue or an ETX issue.
08/18/17 15:37:22 US/Eastern (DPDAVISON):
This is not an AVS issue.

I have talked to Ken and he is not aware of anything the CVT team has built that looks like this.

We also thought maybe someone had taken an old micromedex document and saved it as a smartphrase.  This would explain the black background.  Troy had to make changes to the VPSX to fix the images for Lexicomp because they were black.

I have logged into SUP as Dr Vigh since he did the ICD on the patient.  I do not see any smartphrases or saved favorites in DC instructions to indicate he is the one who added it.

I also logged into SUP as Jammie and she does not have any smartphrases or saved favorites.
08/18/17 14:54:51 US/Eastern (DPDAVISON):
I emailed Elvir, received an out of office message to call the CVT hotline.  I called and the staff who answered the phone was not able to help.  He suggested I call Dillon (it is his last day and he may not have a phone any longer) or Trish (she may or may not be at work).  I was not able to reach either of these folks.

I have emailed Ken Duvall to see if he may be able to lend a hand.  He is looking into this.

Patient MRN is 128080(starnes)
I thought I could print and AVS and fax it to the unit so they had something to give the patient.  However, after I printed it I remember that printing is different with 2017, it prints close to the patient.  I did not see the black background.  Later I found out that they had removed the part that was printing in black.

The client does not know what causes the text to pull in.

Talked with Kelly Saunders.  She said to call Elvir, his team takes care of these documents.

Teresa found a fix - transfering incident.
08/18/17 15:00:10 US/Eastern (KFCOLEMANSMITH):
Spoke with Teresa: The default for Note signing changed because of the Pre-Charting functionality. The default for notes is now ""Sign on Close Encounter"". Sherry will need to change to ""Sign on Closing Note"". This will convert the encounter to Cardio Device Check encounter and allow her to close the encounter without additional close encounter requirements.
08/18/17 14:23:35 US/Eastern (KFCOLEMANSMITH):
Spoke with client: The patient encounters that are scheduled for remote device checks are not converting from an appointment to the Cardiac Device Check encounter. They are staying in an appointment status. She documents a Note, enters charges and closes the encounter. Now she's getting a stop sign that says she has required items. This is because the encounter has not converted.

Carol,

That was not checked, so I’ve checked that box. She is now able to edit the schedule in the production environment.

Still a bit of a mystery – the box is also unchecked in our Test environment and she has no problem making schedule edits there. Any ideas why it wouldn’t work in our live environment, but would in the dev?

Thanks for your help!

Beth

Michelle,

After doing some additional testing on Friday afternoon with your account here is what I learned:

I encountered the same issue in the following scenarios:
1.	Logged in as you and loaded all of the CNRV SCU location for Current Schedule Period
2.	Logged in as you and loaded the CNRV SCU RNs for Current Schedule Period

I did not have the issue in the following scenarios:
1.	Logged in as Christy Rodgers and loaded all of the CNRV SCU location for Current Schedule Period
2.	Logged in as Christy Rodgers and loaded all of the CNRV SCU RNs for Current Schedule Period
3.	Logged in as you and loaded all other jobs besides RNs for CNRV SCU for Current Schedule Period
4.	Logged in as you and loaded any other location besides CRNV SCU
5.	Logged in as you and loaded anything, including CNRV SCU, for up to 3 weeks at a time

I changed several things in your profile to try to correct the problem, but was unsuccessful. You are currently set up exactly like Christy Rodgers, which really gives you the same access you already had, just a slightly different access to the Org Map (you actually now have a few more locations available to select).

I need to let the Kronos support team look at your account to see if they can find something I’ve missed. I know this is Kronos Monday and you are trying to get everything correct on the schedule before your manager signs off on timecards.

Please give me a call as soon as you can so that we can discuss a time that I can log in as you again to show Kronos the issue.

When Michelle brings up the schedule for the Selected Location:

    CC/CNRV/NRS/MED SURG/IP/SCU

The name are all grayed out, as if they have been signed off or are inactive or if it’s herself (No Access to Self). If I bring up the same group of employees, either as myself or as another user with the same FAP, Display, Org Group, etc, the names are not grayed out. This seems to only happen when Current Schedule Period is selected. If she selects 1 or 2 weeks at a time, this doesn’t happen. She is also able to bring up a single job role and it doesn’t happen – except for the RNs.
I have changed her FAP to Manager-Working and Admin-Scheduler to rule out an access issue. It still happens. I have changed her Org Group to be more inclusive of other units, still happens.

This seems to be related to HER login…

I will be escalating to Kronos to get their input. It will be Monday before I hear back from them.

Contacted, remoted into client's PC.
Client was not able to edit the schedule (exp: Add shift, Add pay code..) when the current schedule  period is loaded.  The cell displayed a white thin line only without open the selection box;  However, she had no issues when loaded the Previous Schedule Period or Next  Schedule Period.
The following steps was taken without success.
   - Had her logged out and logged back via Firefox
    - Changed her FAP - issue wasn't resolved.
Beth Clingenpeel will monitor and decide to escalate this issue to the vendor.

Patient who came in and checked in through the Welcome Kiosk on 8/15 was able to successfully sign her consent, pay her copay and was told she was checked on the Kiosk.

However, she waited for 40 minutes before someone came out and realized she wasn't actually checked in, she didn't even show on the daily list as being checked in. The only way they were able to tell she had checked in was the receipt the kiosk printed for her.

User says this is not the first time this has occured and it is causing upsets with patients and delay in care. Unfortunately because this was reported to someone else who then reported it to her, she was unable to confirm exactly which kiosk this occured at, but was able to provide an MRN.

She had no idea what kiosk this occurred at. I told her i will get with someone on Monday to try and get this figured out. She was alright with that. She also mentioned with this particular patient that they were not able to see what kiosk she checked in at on their DAR. She said the patient even printed her receipt from the kiosk.

Spoke with Phyllis. His AD account expired last week as well. We are trying to reach out to him to get the required access forms completed and returned. Emailed Elvir for possible contact information.
08/21/17 09:12:50 US/Eastern (AJMCWHORTER):
Followed up with Stephanie on the SER team. There was nothing unusual in cactus that showed his admitting privileges had been removed. He is an external provider. There was some HIM activity around the end date of 8/17/2017 so I spoke with Brett on the HIM team. He said that typically it would take a whole lot to suspend privileges based on defficiencies. He had a message back in July letting himi know he had documentation to complete but that was it. He suggested talking to Tim Bowman as the notes in his EMP indicated he at one point was an eLink provider. This access was granted for a year at a time. I called and left a message with Tim Bowman to see if he could assist with this.
08/21/17 03:23:38 US/Eastern (AJMCWHORTER):
Ticket states provider record is currently inactive. He is a cardiant provider and has an end date of 8/17/2017. I called Kelly Saunders to verify if the provider was active or not. She felt ok to go ahead and make active. She is not sure why he has an end date listed. Maybe non Carilion. I made active in PRD but will follow up in the morning to determine why he was inactive. Leaving open until I know if he should be active or not. Also, will email client to let her know what I find out as she leaves at 6:00 a.m. No notes in user record.

She had already reached out to the TSC this morning about this issue, Citrix was reinstalled and appears to have helped for a short time, however she is now getting the error again.

TSC had issues trying to remote her device (could not capture screenshot), however I was able to capture the Citrix server she is connected to. She has already closed out of Epic several times to see if this resolved the issue, still comes up. She also notes that other users at her location have had the error on different workstations since last week.

The error message is coming from Epic - its not a Windows message.  This would indicate that this is not a system-level issue...at least not on the Windows side.  Spoke with Mike about this and the message has been seen before (since the 2017 upgrade).  He said that a ticket needs to be opened with Epic for this on the application side.

Called client, did say on workstation earlier that she said was working was set to this printer default is ISS0001957_4P, and said this is another printer in their dept.  Said would be ok to set to this printer, but that other printer was their preference if possible, said will try to set to this printer to see if at least printing their AVS/Discharge will work.
08/21/17 15:23:20 US/Eastern (JRTAN):
already checked all 3 LWS records, did appear to be configured correctly.  Called client asked her to restart devices and try again.  She called back later and said still did not fix issue.  She did give me a workstation that said is printing correctly, but when I checked that LWS record, it appears to be setup to a different default printer than the one they are requesting in ticket.

Called client, but was unable to reach this morning, left message that I checked with vendor Excel Medical and also checked with my teammates to discuss issue.  We looked at the chart and the related anesthesia devices and did not find any data that could be imported into the chart for the missing data that the client had reported on.  Earlier ticket was transferred to us from CE to resolve connectivity issues I believe, and she had a question concerning lost data because of this.  We checked and could not find any data to import and after discussing with others on team, concluded that user would have to document data manually.  Called left message and also left my iphone# for client to call back if she had questions.

If there is no data that can be validated into the chart from the devices then only thing I would think is that the client enter those manually.

Joe, she does not have data from 1503 - 1630 in the patient's chart. She will need to enter those times manually.

Joe, I don't know if there is any other way to pull the information, was this a concern with the validation meetings during the build?

Hey Elaine,


So looking at Walker's response it does not appear any data was retained.  I looked at the patient's Anesthesia Record and looks like case started around 1500 and ended approx 2300 based on the Anesthesia Start/Stop & Data collect event times.


I looked at the interface utilities for the Monitor and Machine listed in the ticket.


Looks like RMHANMON36 stopped collecting data at 4:41pm yesterday and RMHANMACH36 stopped collecting data at 4:37pm yestarday also.  The search criteria I used was for yesterdays date 8/20 from 3pm to 11:30pm and did not have any more data past those times stopped that I could find.




If there was no data to recover to add to the chart, would the recommendation be for her to just manually enter data if she has not already done so?  I just wanted to check if there was anything else that could be done for the client before telling her we are unable to retrieve any data for her.


Thanks,

Joe

Hi Elaine,

BedComm does not retain any data, we send data to the interface as it comes in. I can't speak for the receiving end though.

Hey Elaine,



Wanted to check if you know if this might be data we can recover?  The case was yesterday, so I wasn't sure or if this is something the client would have to reenter manually?

Ticket Info:
Yvette called CE saying that she was working an endo case last night that had to be transferred to the OR.  She stated that after she went to the OR, a half hour into the case she received the red screen in epic.  She stated that when she moved to the OR it asked her if she wanted to merge the chart and she said yes.  She had vitals from the Endo portion at that time.  Once she received the Red screen she rebooted the system and she lost her vitals from the Endo portion of the case.  She still had her OR vitals.  She is wondering where her Endo vitals went.

I just received IM398834 which references an incident that Tanya helped with last week.  To which environment is the current incident tied?  I believe things are getting routed incorrectly to the DBA team.  I am trying to get some background on the current issue before sending it on to another team.

Thanks!

Called and spoke with Mark Vest.
He was very pleasant and just explained that they used to use the ""last four"" of the MRN to determine a ""Passcode"" for visitors for no news patients in placed such as the birthplace and St. Albans.

I am going to reach out to Mary potter to let her know what changed with the upgrade and whether or not it is appropriate for Police officers to have access to No news patients in general now that the system changed slightly on how it displays no news.
08/21/17 17:19:26 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Bret and I researched this issue.
There was a nova note about the EPIC 2017 upgrade in which No News security is actually RESPECTING the security points now.
ADT, Police DEPT were on purpose not given ""No News"" access. But they had a work around all along.
Mark is complaining they can no longer use the workaround.
I need to follow up with the Police Cheif and with Mary Potter to determine if this access is appropriate for all Police Officers.

I tried to call Mark to let him know but he had already left for the day.

I will call him in the morning.

Contacted Cyndi St Clair.  She is on the billing team and is handling any write-offs for Medicare patients but is not a contact person for why these charges are dropping.  Reviewed first  patient on attachment (Helfrich) and found HAR 300984166, charge dos 12/8/14 with charge post date of 8/17/17 for charge 12910071 HB PSG (SLEEP STAGING) 4+ PARMET.  This HAR has not yet billed, in a Waiting status with coding (due to 2014 date).  There is a HAR note from 12/12/14 that the appt was cancelled.  However, from Chart Review, there is a sleep study report from 12/8/14.   Next day, same pt is HAR 300984204, charge dos 12/9/14 with charge post date of 12/9/14 for charge 12910055 HB MULTIPLE SLEEP LATENCY.  This HAR was billed and paid 2014, $0 balance.

1) Why did the charge from the 12/8/14 visit not drop in 2014 and 2) what is causing the charge from 12/8/14 to drop now after the upgrade?  Sending to Amb team based on user's template.  Is it that the Progress Note was just signed - adding a screenshot showing ""Electronically signed by Smith, Michael D, Tech at 8/17/2017 12:01 am"".

I made the contract update in SUP for your review for the example accounts you have indicated.
Please review them in SUP and advise if this is what you want.
The RC 681 is valuing at % of billed charges, however, the variance still exists (would this be due to patient responsibility coming into play?).
Please advise.

Kipp,

I’ve got a ticket for the badge printer here at CNRV (ISC86734). It’s not printing and I’m not able to ping it., however, there are network lights on the back of the device.  I’ve verified that it is connected to CNRVEB ES1/3 port 24 and is on VLAN 207. The spooler may need to be reset again since we had a couple power blinks yesterday. Let me know if you need anything from me. Thanks!

Chris,



I have a ticket over at the SCA. They were recently moved to different areas in the building and new cables have been run etc. The users can no longer access MOST FTP sites, they are getting connection refused and or server errors.

Most connections are going to scacreditservices.carilion.com which can ping just fine

They mentioned that FTP was turned off and to use SFTP which they are, so my question is: Anything blocking FTP access over at the SCA?

SCAGIGE-2 is where some pcs are on

Jennifer,

Is the issue that the forms are not printing or is the alignment off?
Was the printer recently replaced?  If so, what kind of printer?
If not, were new forms recently loaded into the printer?  If yes, were the forms loaded properly?

If it is an alignment issue, we also need an example so that we can see if the alignment is vertical or horizontal.

Hi Michele,

Thank you for your ticket.  I am following up from a voice message that I just left for you.  It appears that you have actually already started the Event Review.  I was able to see your most recent Reviews:

Review - 00512 -- This has already been started, and only the ""Complete Review"" button will be available.

Review - 04872 -- This was Auto-Closed by a facilitator.

If you are having an issue with a different Review, please provide that Event number.

Thank you!

I am trying to see if I can find out how to pull data into our epic note template for anti-coagulation encounters.  In the anti-coagulation navigator, there is a table where it allows you to edit the dosage by each day of the week. This is how we adjust dosage at these encounters. We would like to be able to pull this data into our note and patient instructions to improve patient care practice wide.  I am not aware if there is currently a smartphrase that does this. I can design the template but will need  a .flowsheet or other epic tool that can pull the data by day or if there are any other suggestions.  Thank you.

met with director of Central Sterile and went over the issue. Then went to the location of the PC, dressed for the environment and disconnected everything. Took computer completely apart and went through it. Doesn't look like any water made it's way inside. Put PC back together and checked over both keyboards, mice and scanners. All look ok so I plugged it all back up and then booted it up. Also cleaned PC while I had it apart. PC booted up to the desktop. I tested a few apps and it looks fine. Removed sterile dress and met with Team Lead as Director was not there. I let her know and some of the staff onsite that the PC was fine and operational.
