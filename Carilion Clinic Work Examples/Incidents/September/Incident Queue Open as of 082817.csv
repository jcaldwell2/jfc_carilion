This incident is related to a chart correction that needs coding to make corrections before this can be resolved.  Is there someone that can address the changes needed?

I believe Elaine Montgomery was the one making the request.  Below is what is in the incident, I am not sure if this provides you the details needed, or if you need more information.  If so, can you check back with Elaine?

CHART CORRECTION - I was contacted by Legal who is working on Guardianship/Conservator paperwork for this patient and his date of birth and last name are incorrect. Also, documentation in his chart refers to him as a 60 year old male when he is actually over 70 years of age. Following is the email I received:

  ""I'm working on a guardian/conservator petition for a patient at CRMH, and the record has an incorrect birth date, which the patient has acknowledged is incorrect.  The social worker contacted Patient Access to request a change of the birth date but was told that change cannot occur until the patient is discharged.  The problem is that, in multiple progress notes, the physicians are referring to the patient as a ""60-year old male,"" when he is actually over 70 years old.  The patient's MRN is 998939, last name is Berrman; however, the medical record appears to still refer to him as Berriom.  Long story short, this patient has utilized multiple aliases, but his social worker Brittany has received confirmation of legal name and birth date from Social Security and the VA.  You likely want to reach out to Brittany to get additional information on this patient issue.""   I have reached out to Legal and asked for Brittany's last name and phone number.

sent email to client...

Hello Sam,

Ok, what I found out about not being able to add Dr. Unwin as a PCP.
A committee of providers got together and decided what type of providers should be allowed to be a PCP for a patient. It was decided the specialty of Geriatrics should not be included. Therefore any provider with a specialty of Geriatrics cannot be a PCP for a patient.

Dr. Speaker, one of the providers in that group said they would re-review this if a case is made for a Geriatric provider to be marked as a PCP.

Do you want to reply with the reasons why we need Dr. Unwin to be the PCP and I will take it up with them and try and get this reversed?

Let me know.

Thanks.
07/18/17 10:55:33 US/Eastern (DLCAMERON):
David,
This provider has a specialty type of Geriatric Medicine.  With the 2015 upgrade we moved to using the provider’s specialty in an extension to determine who could be listed as a PCP.  Dr. Speaker approved the list of specialties for us, but Geriatric Medicine was not one of them, so that is why this provider can’t be chosen as a PCP.  I think we would need his approval to update the LPP which would allow this provider to be chosen.  Let us know if this helps.

Subject: question

I have an issue I can’t figure out, and I wonder if you might have some guidance. A nurse is trying to add Dr. Brian Unwin, specialty of Geriatrics,  as a PCP on a patient. She is unable too. She is able to add this provider to the Care Team, but not as a PCP.

The SER team reports the SER is ok
The Cadence team says the patient is not dismissed or anything like that.
The only thing I see in common is we cannot add other providers from the same specialty as a PCP either.
The nurse is able to add other providers as a PCP so I don’t think it is an access issue.

Thoughts?

Thanks.

Client called me back. She is trying to add Dr. Brian Unwin as a PCP. This provider can not be added as a PCP. He can be added to the care team, but just not as a PCP.
Client is able to add other providers as PCPs. It does not seem to be her access.
Going to ask the SER team if there is a setting in the ser to allow PCP.

Hello Sam,
I see in the chart the PCP is still blank. Who are you trying to add? They might be an external provider that does not have a record in Epic.

I tried calling you at the the number they gave me, 540-526-1160 but it seemed to be the wrong number.

Thanks.

08/17/17 10:07:32 US/Eastern (EACLINGENPEEL):
Connected Rose Hurd and Savorn Kong through a conference call to talk about the error. Savorn made the request to have Rose use Kronos through direct link instead of using the Citrix icon. She is able to do this by opening Firefox and typing kronos.carilion.com in the address bar. He would like for her to try this for a week to see if she still gets the error. She has agreed to do this.

I will also contact the Staffing Office and ask them to do the same thing. I have sent an email to Kathy Ott and attached a reminder notice to be hung up next to the staffing computer. The attachment I sent is on the attachment tab and the email is pasted below:

Subject: Kronos - 2 Items

Kathy,

I have 2 items for you – 1 is a request for the Staffing Office, the other is for your review:

1.	When Kevin and I were there last week to meet with Brandie & you, we were talking to Karen Reese while she was doing some staffing. She casually mentioned an error that she has been seeing pop up recently that we thought had disappeared. It happens to be the same error that Rose Hurd has reported. Until Karen said something, we thought just Rose was getting it because no one else had reported it. The error doesn’t keep the user from doing anything or information from saving, it’s mainly an annoyance, but still needs to be fixed. We are working with Kronos to solve. I was on the phone with Rose and a Kronos support person this morning and he would like to see if this error is related to the version of Citrix we are currently running. To test this we are asking Rose to not use the Kronos icon on the desktop, but instead open Firefox and type Kronos.carilion.com to get to Kronos. Will you also ask the Staffing Office to do this? We would like for them to try this for a week to see if going around the Citrix server gets rid of the error. I’ve attached a note that can be posted in the staffing workspace as a reminder for them. We would like to get a report of results at the end of next week. Doesn’t have to be detailed – just “didn’t see the error at all today” or “still had the error 2 times”, etc. The error we are looking for is NGUI – 00090 and will come up in a box with a pink header.

We are still trying to track down this error. Another user is now reporting it as well. When is a good time for Kronos to be able to observe your use of Kronos to see if they can catch it as it happens?

Rose,

Kronos has not been able to replicate this error in house; they can see the error in the data log, so they know it happens. Are you still receiving the error? If so, is there a time that would be good for them to remote in to watch as you work to see if they can catch the error as it happens?

Thanks!

Subject: Update on Kronos issues

Rose,

I just wanted to follow up with you about your open tickets with us about issues in Kronos.

Kevin may have already followed up with you – but he has opened a case with Kronos Global Support (KGS) about the names & schedules not lining up. Kronos requested a copy of our test environment database so that they could attempt to reproduce the problem themselves and try to find a solution. We were able to get that to them yesterday. You are not the only user to report this scrolling issue.

I opened a case with KGS about the NGUI-00090 error that you are receiving. They will also be using the copy of our database to see if they can get that error message to show up for them. We also sent a copy of the database logs that show the error during the time that you received it. This will help them research if there was something else going on in the system at the same time. We still have not received any other reports of other users having received this error message. Do you know of anyone else who has seen this message pop up? Are you still getting this error on a regular basis?

We will let you know when we get any further updates from Kronos about these issues.

Thanks!

Beth

Spoke with Rose - she received error as she was editing an employee's schedule

Activities performed:
1. Previously edited shift time to indicate employee staying over original shift end time & added comment saying that employee was staying longer than originally planned
2. Checked timecard to see what time employee actually left
3. Went back to schedule and edited the shift again to remove extra time at the end of shift because employee did not actually stay longer; also removed comment
4. Click save and receive error
5. Change is actually saved, but still get error message.
6. Click OK on error message and confirm that change has been saved

SE reports 24 log files on this device. I emailed provider that I needed at very minimum a date & did he remember any details on the existing files. If not, then moving forward he will have to let me know when it happens again otherwise, I will close the ticket since I cannot proceed without this information.
08/23/17 10:13:04 US/Eastern (DAPOORE):
I called the provider. He reported the error has continued to happen since the upgrade. He reports when the error happens & terminates the session, sometimes the workflow tracer is no longer available. When this happpens, he hits the tracer when he restarts the application.

emailed KCarico to add tracer log files for this device to the SLG. I have asked him to attach any files they obtain from this device since the user cannot remember when it happens & does not contact us when it does even after repeated requests to do so.

I will also contact the client to ask if if it has happened since the upgrade & to use the tracer if it does. Thanks

Javon added the workflow tracer to the device in the ticket & uploaded some files to the Epic SLG 3340846 on 8/4. These files didn’t reveal the needed information so we asked the doctor to continue to use the tracer. I have been on vacation & have not heard anything from the provider. I cannot reach him to ask if he has had the error recur & clicked the workflow tracer.

Thanks

Per Dr.Collier:



Collier, Bryan R, DO  Bradshaw, Tina D, MOA



     You are right. I was present on July 3. All events happened prior to midnight. I am not sure how to change in the chart at this point.""

I then sent the below email back to Tina and Julie.

""Hey Tina and Julie,

He won’t be able to change what the other provider wrote in his note..but Dr. Collier can addend his attestation on that note. I logged in as him in SUP and it’s fairly simple.

Based on his communication, I don’t need to change anything that was requested in Julie’s ticket, correct?

Ticket information:
“Issue reported by user:
Date of death needs to be changed from 7/3/17 to 7/4/17.

Per Dr Collier who was in room at time of death:
Incorrect Time of Death: 7/3/17 at 2349
Correct Time of Death: 7/4/17 at 0023”


I can send this ticket to a physician trainer who can reach out to Dr. Collier to help him addend his attestation if he wants to change his verbiage from 7/4 to 7/3, once I have confirmation from you all no action needs to be taken from a technology perspective.


Thanks.""
08/02/17 11:14:43 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Received communication from Julie and billing folks below that Dr. Collier wants to ""edit"" the note because the DoD is actually 7/4/17. See my below email coorespondence with HIM and Billing.

""Hey team,

This one is a little tricky because Dr. Collier did not write the note. He co-signed another physician’s note (Dr. Rosenblat) with this Attestation “I was present with the resident on July 4 for the history, exam, and medical decision making when they were involved. I discussed the case and agree with the findings and plan as documented in the note and what is listed above.” In which Dr. Rosenblat stated the ToD was 23:49 on 7/3/17.

Also there are flowsheets that stop recording the patient’s vitals at 23:49 on 7/3/17 recorded by a different individual (Valerie Davis RN. These flowsheets indicate 0 pulse at 23:49 on 7/3/17.

Also there was a code blue initiated at 23:20 by Valerie Davis RN in which the code blue ended at 23:49 on 7/3/17 with a pulse of 0.

From a technology perspective we can help “correct” anything that needs to be corrected, but based on the information that is in EPIC by multiple folks I don’t feel very confident in making the changes / helping the provider with the changes being asked for.

From an operational perspective who can analyze this and make the decision of what the DoD should be? There are multiple pieces of clinical data currently supporting 7/3/17 23:49 but Dr. Collier is communicating with Billing operational folks that the date needs to be 7/4/17.

Dr. Collier did get back to me and feels the DOS should be 7/3/17.    He can not addend his note to reflect 7/3 vs 7/4/17.   Can someone call him or get with him on how to addend his note ?

Kari Spradlin sent me the below email ""Yes, this is one that the Analyst sent to have me review and change.

The resident documented a death pronouncement note filed on 7/4/17 1:47 pm (note started on 7/4 at 12:30 am), stating the time of death was called at 11:49 pm. This would be a late entry note due to death occurring so close to midnight. This note is co-signed by Dr. Collier. The death record in the flow sheets also states TOD as 2349 on 7/3/17. On the vital signs flow sheet the vitals ended at 2349 on 7/3 and show a pulse of 0. Also, no other events took place after that time.

I don't see any information in the documentation that we normally look at to determine date/time of death to support that Dr. Collier was in the room on 7/4 at 0023 and/or pronounced death at that time.

Based on the information I reviewed in the record, I feel that 7/3/17 @ 2349 is the correct discharge date/time of death for this record. ""


In which I then emailed Julie Jones
""Hey Julie,

I received your helpdesk ticket and did a little research in EPIC. Upon doing research I noticed Kari Spradlin had abstracted the chart from an HIM perspective and changed the discharge and associated DoD with that information. She said that she found “The resident documented a death pronouncement note filed on 7/4/17 1:47 pm (note started on 7/4 at 12:30 am), stating the time of death was called at 11:49 pm 7/3/17.

On the vital signs flow sheet the vitals ended at 2349 on 7/3 and show a pulse of 0. Also, no other events took place after that time.”

HIM believes the appropriate DoD is 7/3/17 @ 23:49 due to their abstracting process. Did you find any documentation in EPIC from Dr. Collier that would support the DoD being changed to 7/4/17? The screenshots attached to the helpdesk ticket you submitted were of a workqueue and I did not see any clinical information in them with Dr. Collier saying the DoD was on 7/4/17.

I’d be glad to chat with you over the phone about this if you’d like.

Hey Kari,

I received a helpdesk ticket from Julie at CASB in billing wanting to change the date of death time on a patient. I see in Event Management on the patient you had changed the discharge date on this patient from 7/4/17 early to 7/3/17 late. I imagine you were doing abstracting and noticed documentation that indicated to do so. Can you tell me what you were looking at when you made that change? In he helpJulie says Dr. Collier was in the room at the time of death and it was 7/4/17 0023, but a clinical RN was the person who initially made the DoD on 7/3/17.

Any thoughts on the appropriate date of death from your perspective?


Patient Name: Harold Blankenship
Patient MRN: 098557




Thank you!


I will follow up with her tomorrow when she is in the office.

While using Dragon Medical One, the users are unable to dictate into the Diagnosis field on the AMB side. This helps the providers save a lot of time typing out long dx codes for dx entry.

This ticket should go to the Medical Imaging team since they own Dragon now. This will have to be discussed with Nuance and potentially Epic. It can also be researched at TSG with the SA/Medical Imaging teams.

This workflow worked prior to the upgrade so it is likely not a Dragon issue but an Epic issue or some other system that changed with the upgrade.

I'm looking at the the servers now and she has a profile on two out of the five servers.  They look a bit old.  I've deleted them in case that's the issue.  I don't see an issue with the servers and we've currently 42 sessions pretty much evenly distributed across all five servers.

Looked at her AD account and she should be fine for access to the application.  Here AD account is in all the groups needed.  Added it specifically to the app to be sure.

Since she's able to connect to other apps I don't think there's a overall SSL issue here.  If that was the case we'd have a lot more tickets from across multiple applications.

I logged onto the apps portal and was able to launch the Clintrac application to the logon screen successfully.

Ask her if she's entering her user name in caps.  I've seen an issue with a specific alpha combination in the past if it was entered in caps but this combination isn't in her user name.  Just a thought.  Recommend that she try it in lower case if she's not.

I'm out of the office today resting up for tonight's Epic2017 go live.  Hope this helps.

Hi Kevin,

I have a ticket IM396300 where the person is having trouble accessing Clintrac via the apps portal.

The ticket states, "" Vendor is unable to open Clintrac from the apps portal.
I spent time with the user uninstalling and reinstalling the correct Citrix version, we verified that she can open Epic with no issues but when she tries to open Clintrac the application will not open fully and allow her to log in (window closes out).

We Added Citrix_Softmed AD Group

I spoke with Amber Sterling.  After she signs into portal (apps site) she gets the citrix desktop.  She clicks the clintrac icon and it says connecting, then starting and it hangs.  Client has tried with Chrome and IE.

I had her install firefox and test.  Firefox throws: Unable to connect to the Citrix XEN App.   Server.fsl error 34.  She has tried in Chrome IE, & Firefox.    She is able to access Epic, the Citirx Desktop etc.

She can sign into the Citrix Desktop (other icons launch, such as Epic and the Carilion Desktop) when she clicks the Clintrac icon that is when she gets the error.  The 1st login box never loads.

I let Stephanie Johnson know who stated, “Hmmm, I have asked Lonnie and Kevin and we have no idea.  That's new to us.  Maybe Kevin Zeitz would have some idea.”

Is this something you can assist with?

Ticket is IM396300 – AD ASTERLING

Okay, this doesn't sound like a Clintrac issue to me.  Sounds more like something from a server perspective maybe?  I tried to call her and also did not get her.  I want to make sure that she is logging into the first Windows screen with her AD account and password and then does she even get the 3M login or is she not even getting to that second login.

Hi Stephanie,

Her access was setup 3/13/17 by LFPHILLIPS (task T143970).  I’m not sure if she has been able to sign in before.  I attempted to reach the client but she didn’t answer this morning.  We tested the access in Firefox as she it was just hanging in Chrome and IE, although she is able to access epic in all three via apps.carilionclinic.org.

Firefox throws the error: Unable to connect to the Citrix XEN App.   Server.fsl error 34.

Research and reaction to Cactus technical support information.  Email copied below.  Summary - Carilion Cactus NPDB account holder must login to NPDB site and confirm user account information.
====================================
Hello Cheryl and Karen.

Cheryl - Thanks for recently helping me test the Cactus access to the NPDB site via NPDB QRXS query.  Here is the message generated by our test: To ensure account security, the account holder must sign in

According to Cactus support this following needs to occur:


-  The 'account creator' in Cactus for the NPDB has to login to the NPDB and verify that the correct people are in the NPDB account.  This is not Cactus related and is required as part of NPDB security.  (see attached for screenshots - Karen looks to be setup as NPDB account holder)

-  NPDB may ask to verify an IP address.  Cheryl and I saw this step, but we still received the message indicated above.

-  According to Cactus, after the account information is verified and the correct all should be successfully access the NPDB data.


Karen - As the current account holder, are you able to login to the NPDB site and verify the account and the people associated with the account?  Cactus support verified that in our case, the System Administrators are not part of the account setup in environment.



Thanks,

-  confirmed Cheryl can access the NPDB site directly with her account, but query Error Details indicate that 'account holder must sign in'
-  email sent to Cactus support requesting further assistance

================================
Regarding NPDB access and response below.  We confirmed that the .NET Framework key value is 379893.  We also confirmed no host files and that the below web addresses can be reached on our Cactus Citirx server.

Additionally, I tested with a user that has an NPDB account and can successfully login to the NPDB site.  When she runs the NPDB query from within Cactus, the query fails with the Error Details description - 'To ensure account security, the account holder must sign in'.  Please see attached screen shot of the Error Details and Query Status.

Request further support assistance.  Query user can be available for further troubleshooting as needed.

------------------------------------
Hi Kevin,

As we just discussed on the phone about the credentialing issue you are having in 3.14.31, I can have a Support representative reach out on Wednesday when you are free to assist with the cred counts utility/cred fix utility.

Regarding the ""Error opening connection to Data Bank server, check Internet"" NPDB error, here is some more information that will help you and the rest of your IT team with ensuring all settings are good to go on your side with the NPDB using Visual CACTUS 3.14.31.

First, if any host files are used on local computers or servers, the new NPDB address will need to be mapped. The new address is http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/ with an IP address of 54.186.167.170 on port 443. Unfortunately, the NPDB has lingering issues with migrating all its old addresses, or alternatively, forwarding old DNS addresses to its new location. For example, http://npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov/ is no longer valid, but http://www.npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov correctly forwards to http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/. To connect, you will want to ensure host files, routing, and firewalls at all levels account for these changes.

Also, you will want to verify that the end users are running Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher on their workstations. The easiest way to verify this is to go to the registry on the workstation and verify the build. You will want to go to
Start > Run > regedit.exe, then navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full.

(for Kevin - do these need to be added on the cacti-prd-db02 server?)
First, if any host files are used on local computers or servers, the new NPDB address will need to be mapped. The new address is http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/ with an IP address of 54.186.167.170 on port 443. Unfortunately, the NPDB has lingering issues with migrating all its old addresses, or alternatively, forwarding old DNS addresses to its new location. For example, http://npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov/ is no longer valid, but http://www.npdb-hipdb.hrsa.gov correctly forwards to http://www.npdb.hrsa.gov/. To connect, you will want to ensure host files, routing, and firewalls at all levels account for these changes.

(for Stacy - should our users be current with 4.5.2 or higher?)
Also, you will want to verify that the end users are running Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or higher on their workstations. The easiest way to verify this is to go to the registry on the workstation and verify the build. You will want to go to
Start > Run > regedit.exe, then navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full.

The other coverages for the patient do not appear because this HAR is attached to the Auto Guarantor which only has Generic Auto attached to it. The patients P/F account has the Medicaid coverage attached to it. This has been the behavior all along. I pulled up version 2015 and looked up this account and only the Auto appears as well.

Thank you for the examples. The charge sessions are splitting because the Service Providers are different.  See example below.  All information must match for the charges to be included in one charge session. This does not affect claims. The charges will be pulled back together during claim run.

I like your idea.  If you find that certain S codes are coming up as common overrides, we can code around those if that makes sense. One suggestion - We could make these still go to wq 1362 but take away the override and instead they transfer to a new HB wq.  That way they can fix their mistakes without you having to look at them first.

Hi Cyndi,
Angie and I reviewed this ticket and I am now working on it.  So we are in somewhat of a corner, i.e., occurrence code 11 didn't get automatically added because of the ""S"" code and then the PAS user overrode the claim edit so we end up with no S code.  Here are next steps:
1) The S code on this claim is S81.801S Unspecified open wound, right lower leg, sequela.  Is that one of the S codes that is excluded from needing an accident code?  After talking with Epic, if we can get the list of S codes that do not indicate accident we may be able to improve the automated logic for adding 11 by excluding these S codes.  In the past you have stated there are a lot of exceptions.  Is it possible to pull together this list and send it over?
2) As a short-term fix, I can add a claim edit when there is no occurrence code 01-06 or 11.  This would probably need to be worked by HB.  I don't think we want to go the route of PAS updating the claim directly, at least not right now.
3) What were you doing before PAS had the override?
thanks,
Barbara

Reviewed examples.  I unbilled and re-billed one of them in SUP to verify the Occ Code 11 was missing before any edits were made to the claim and it was.  I did get the claim edit that client mentions regarding the accident Dx.
Reviewed the CDF for Medicare and see the logic for Occ Code.  For OC 11 - Onset of Symptoms/Illness, there are two lines in the table using rules 740897 & 740898.
740897 - CC HB 11 Dx Not Accident
74098 - CC HB 11 Pt Recurring

The claims for these two examples do not meet either of these rules to automatically get OC 11.  Will need to f/u with co-worker to verify that this is the only logic that controls Occ Code.  I could not find anything in the HSD.

She said she would have this done by Monday and would call in for assistance once they have them loaded onto the drive. They are very expensive to send and can't afford to have any of these come back. Users might be using Windows/Macs to read the files.

08/17/17 12:56:03 US/Eastern (PLWHITESCARVER):
I think this might have to do with an issue that we had a couple of years ago with ADT.  Will be talking to Tara when she returns from a meeting

Sometimes if an IP admission is not closed out it links together notes in the Telephone Encounter.  What will happen is when you create a new telephone note it will list every note that was done previously
Have to send to ADT to have them close the Admit
 
Here is Collen's response:
I think I found the issue here.  That patient has an admission from November of 2009 that was never closed.  It's in Endoscopy RCH, which has a setting in the profile to make encounters within 30 days of the encounter a related encounter.  The admission has never been closed, so it's relating all the encounters since that day.  The documentation section of the telephone encounters navigator only displays telephone notes, so it's only pulling in those from the ""related"" encounters.
To fix the encounters that were already linked, you'll want to close that admission and use patient station to unlink them.  You can do this by opening patient station, removing the filters on the patient, and clicking the check box next to the encounter to remove the check mark.  This unrelates the encounter.
I don't know if you'll want to change the setting or not, but it's something to consider.
I'm not sure if other patients were affected by this.  We might be able to run a search to find out, but it doesn't seem like it affects patient safety or data accuracy at all, so I don't know how critical it is.

Response from Nuance

Typically when it comes to  delays or freezing issues. We would advise to check on the following
•	Could you check if your antivirus exceptions are in place?
•	Could you check amount of free disk space maintained on your C:\.
•	 At times, these time lags could be due to unwanted data present within the profile , you might have to clean up these un-necessary data from the user profiles  to ensure  steady performance for Dragon and to avoid any delays.
•	Could you check if customer is maintaining a large number of  Auto-texts and/or Custom Commands .Typically, customers who maintain a large number of Auto-texts and/or Custom Commands can experience login delays impacting their DMNE 2.x clients.  The delay duration is longest during the initial login of the user profile.  However, less pronounced delays can also occur with subsequent logins.

She said she didn't have the precise data to enter manually but wrote a quick note that the data / parameters she observed was within normal parameters and noted that patient was stable throughout the endo procedure.  Client wanted to know if the note she wrote was acceptable from a compliance standpoint, told her I'd check with some other folks on the team, sent email to Elaine and Dawn if they agree or know if anything else needs to be added to patient's chart.  - JTan.

Subject: IM398778 - Case with Missing Anesthesia Data


Hi Elaine / Dawn,


This is in regards to the ticket earlier in the week for the missing Anesthesia Data.  Per client for a brief moment in the middle of the case she got the Red Screen of death on her

intraop grid, after talking with her she said she had rebooted the PC several times and the Red Screen went away while patient was in Endo.  They had to transfer patient from Endo to

the OR, but said they lost her Endo Data.  This happened after hours during the weekend.  CE had the ticket and worked on the hardware issues, but she asked if there was anyway to recover her missing data.  CE transferred me the ticket on Monday.  We asked Walker with Excel if devices saved any data, and learned they do not.  Also wasn't sure how long device data is kept in the Epic System before being purged.  We were unable to recover any data and informed the client that she would have to manually enter the data.


She replied that she didn't have the precise information to manually document and did not want to make up any numbers so she wrote a quick note.  Her question was if there was anything else she needed to do and if the quick note was acceptable from a compliance standpoint.  I told her I'd check with some other folks on the team.  Copy of the note entry in the Anesthesia Record below:



Let me know if there is any other additional documentation needed, or if what she documented given the situation is acceptable for this patient's record.


Thanks,

Joe

Called client, but was unable to reach this morning, left message that I checked with vendor Excel Medical and also checked with my teammates to discuss issue.  We looked at the chart and the related anesthesia devices and did not find any data that could be imported into the chart for the missing data that the client had reported on.  Earlier ticket was transferred to us from CE to resolve connectivity issues I believe, and she had a question concerning lost data because of this.  We checked and could not find any data to import and after discussing with others on team, concluded that user would have to document data manually.  Called left message and also left my iphone# for client to call back if she had questions.

Joe, she does not have data from 1503 - 1630 in the patient's chart. She will need to enter those times manually.

Joe, I don't know if there is any other way to pull the information, was this a concern with the validation meetings during the build?

Hey Elaine,


So looking at Walker's response it does not appear any data was retained.  I looked at the patient's Anesthesia Record and looks like case started around 1500 and ended approx 2300 based on the Anesthesia Start/Stop & Data collect event times.


I looked at the interface utilities for the Monitor and Machine listed in the ticket.


Looks like RMHANMON36 stopped collecting data at 4:41pm yesterday and RMHANMACH36 stopped collecting data at 4:37pm yestarday also.  The search criteria I used was for yesterdays date 8/20 from 3pm to 11:30pm and did not have any more data past those times stopped that I could find.




If there was no data to recover to add to the chart, would the recommendation be for her to just manually enter data if she has not already done so?  I just wanted to check if there was anything else that could be done for the client before telling her we are unable to retrieve any data for her.


Thanks,

Joe

Emailed requester this:

Hi Chris, I spoke to the vendor and went over the two systems and could not find anything using that domain account. I worked with a technician named George Moreno and he checked the automatic backup and the updates and both go to their external server. The only failure they see is with uploading a log file after updating but that fails on uploading back to their server. He is keeping a ticket open as we gather more information. Next would be to know more details from our side regarding the failed logins. Such as day, time, which Carepoint PC and any details regarding the failed login try. Can you let me know what you find out and I will engage the vendor again to match up the data?

Thank you,

Mary is emailing me back and wanted to know if the MRN can be added back to the No news patient identifier.
I sent her the below email

""Hey Mary,

Unfortunately It can not be to my knowledge. I am going to work further with EPIC, but from what I understand, the MRN was never supposed to be shown for folks who did not have no news access. Here’s the reason:

If the MRN shows after the asterisks, the user has a workaround to use that MRN to look up the patient in for instance the patient station activity and it will display who the patient is.. kind of defeating the purpose of blocking the patient’s identifiers if you can look them up by the MRN easily.

Mark says this is not a huge deal, but wanted to know if as a whole we would allow the police dept to see no news patients.



Thanks for your help!""
08/24/17 12:31:45 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Sent an email to Mark letting him know Mary is out of the office until Monday 8/28/17 and that I am trying to work with Beth Snead in Mary's absence. The decision may have to wait until Mary returns.
08/23/17 16:06:37 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Research issue further and constructed an email to the Privacy Officer at Carilion Clinic. (Below)
Hey Mary,

I received a helpdesk ticket from Mark Vest at CNRV. He is a Police Officer with access to EPIC in which the “ADT, Police DEPT” template does not have access to Confidential data (No News Patients). He and about 45-50 other Police Officers use this template in EPIC. The issue he reported is this:

Previous to EPIC 2017 – Users who DID NOT have access to No News Patients (Confidential Data) saw patients on their house Census like this - ****** (MRN# 1234565)

After the EPIC upgrade to version 2017 – Users who DO NOT have access to No New Patients (Confidential Data) see patients like this now -    ******

Therefore users who’s EPIC security were built specifically not to have No News patients used to be able to see the MRN # associated with the No News patient. Now they cannot. Police used to use the MRN # as a “Secret Password” for visitors who may be visiting a No News Patient that may be in CNRV’s Birthplace (a locked down area).

Do you think it is appropriate to give all Police Officers access to No News patients now that they cannot see any identifier at all on patients in activities like patient lists / house censuses? Mark said he would be glad to speak to you if you have additional work flow related questions.

Currently only 3 Police type folks have access to No News patients. They are the “Police Chiefs” and are on a separate Police Chief EPIC template. (Bobby Lugar, Ron Donelson, Patricia Hepburn)


Please feel free to reach out to me if you’d rather chat on the phone or in person about this.


Thanks!
08/22/17 11:26:49 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Called and spoke with Mark Vest.
He was very pleasant and just explained that they used to use the ""last four"" of the MRN to determine a ""Passcode"" for visitors for no news patients in placed such as the birthplace and St. Albans.

I am going to reach out to Mary potter to let her know what changed with the upgrade and whether or not it is appropriate for Police officers to have access to No news patients in general now that the system changed slightly on how it displays no news.
08/21/17 17:19:26 US/Eastern (WMQUESENBERRY):
Bret and I researched this issue.
There was a nova note about the EPIC 2017 upgrade in which No News security is actually RESPECTING the security points now.
ADT, Police DEPT were on purpose not given ""No News"" access. But they had a work around all along.
Mark is complaining they can no longer use the workaround.
I need to follow up with the Police Cheif and with Mary Potter to determine if this access is appropriate for all Police Officers.

I tried to call Mark to let him know but he had already left for the day.

I will call him in the morning.

That's a lot of studies to re-do and we were never advised of an issue sending to D.R. that day.

Contacted Cyndi St Clair.  She is on the billing team and is handling any write-offs for Medicare patients but is not a contact person for why these charges are dropping.  Reviewed first  patient on attachment (Helfrich) and found HAR 300984166, charge dos 12/8/14 with charge post date of 8/17/17 for charge 12910071 HB PSG (SLEEP STAGING) 4+ PARMET.  This HAR has not yet billed, in a Waiting status with coding (due to 2014 date).  There is a HAR note from 12/12/14 that the appt was cancelled.  However, from Chart Review, there is a sleep study report from 12/8/14.   Next day, same pt is HAR 300984204, charge dos 12/9/14 with charge post date of 12/9/14 for charge 12910055 HB MULTIPLE SLEEP LATENCY.  This HAR was billed and paid 2014, $0 balance.

1) Why did the charge from the 12/8/14 visit not drop in 2014 and 2) what is causing the charge from 12/8/14 to drop now after the upgrade?  Sending to Amb team based on user's template.  Is it that the Progress Note was just signed - adding a screenshot showing ""Electronically signed by Smith, Michael D, Tech at 8/17/2017 12:01 am"".

The alignment is off on the claim and attached is an example of how the claims are printing. I have highlighted where the alignment is off on the claim. Its not off too much however some of our payors are very picky and even being out of alignment slightly can cause our claims to be denied.The printer hasn't recently been changed and forms were loaded properly.

Jennifer,

Is the issue that the forms are not printing or is the alignment off?
Was the printer recently replaced? If so, what kind of printer?
If not, were new forms recently loaded into the printer? If yes, were the forms loaded properly?

If it is an alignment issue, we also need an example so that we can see if the alignment is vertical or horizontal.

Thanks,

Was the printer recently replaced?  If so, what kind of printer?
If not, were new forms recently loaded into the printer?  If yes, were the forms loaded properly?

If it is an alignment issue, we also need an example so that we can see if the alignment is vertical or horizontal.

Thanks,
Chris S.

If they are making reference to IM387777 - the issue I had was that the forms were printing but the alignment was off. Is that same issue here?

If not, this is a different issue.

If it is, we need to know the following:
Was the printer recently replaced?
If so, what kind of printer?
If not, were new forms recently loaded into the printer?  If yes, were the forms loaded properly?
We also need an example so that we can see if the alignment is vertical or horizontal.

Karen,
We believe this is happening because the  router logic only updates this if the original DEP includes US, Mammo and CT for Daleville and this one is for DX.  The task involved with this is VCT - PB SET POS FOR DALEVILLE IMAGING AND WESTLAKE IMAGING [100623].

Does DX also need to be included?

From Kelly:

When the EKG window is open, the staff need to be able to also document what they see in epic.  At this point, when the window is open, they can’t.  They have to write it down, close the window, and then enter the information in epic.

We never heard back from ASAP support.  We talked with Andrea Epic TS for ADT and Adam.  They could not figure this out either.  Opened SLG 3381959 for both ADT and HIM at Epic to research further.

Also client emailed me and I updated her on what we have found and that Epic is looking at this.
08/23/17 17:16:22 US/Eastern (KESTEAHLY):
WOrked with Joyce on this.   We are now waiting on Clindoc to get back with us on what auto undo discharge is so we can try and figure out how these nurses names got in here.  We were unable to recreate but all the examples had this auto undo discharge associated with them.   Waiting on reply from Todd to further research.
08/23/17 16:16:27 US/Eastern (JWBOOKER):
Worked with Karen regarding the issue.  Created test patients in test environment to recreate the situation.  In Production found that the patients are showing in event management as an auto undo discharge event by the nurse.  This action appears to be making the RN as the process user.  I called Todd Null (on call for ASAP) and he is validating this workflow.
08/23/17 15:01:11 US/Eastern (MTNULL):
Confirmed that the Encounter Status ""Undone to Confirmed Admission"" with a reason of ""(ED auto undo)"" occurrs in the ED when a patient is discharged and the ED RN clicks the ""Undo ED Discharge/Dismiss"" button in the menu.  This feature has been available for a number of years and the IP team did not alter any configuration related to it during the 2017 upgrade.  We tested this feature in POC, SUP and RLB with the same results visible in the Patient Events Activity and in Event Management.  Is it possible that a change in Identity configuration changed to cause these events to create a deficiency?
08/23/17 14:12:27 US/Eastern (BAHERRALA):

Hello Annette,

I have received a ticket for the DVD/VCR combo in CRCH RM 203.  The VHS tapes don’t enter the machine properly and one side sticks up causing the tapes not to play.  The instructor needs this to work so he can use the tapes next Wednesday.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks and have a great day,

This is a big issue. Please advise.

Mandy,


Good morning!  I just tried to reach you at 540-449-5900 to resolve the ticket you opened yesterday, SD875766.  For this, we would just need to downgrade your receiver, which should only take about 5 minutes.  Please let me know if there is a better time to get you, and we will take care of this issue for you.


Thank you so much for your time!

She states that this is happening for her as well as a co-worker, only started after the upgrade.

She is going to the patients encounter, clicking notes and then clicking prenatal viatals and notes. This causes the note to open but it appears to be blank.

If she goes into the notes section of the encounter and clicks the hyperlink for the incomplete note, it will pop-up the in use message.

She is unsure what is causing this issue but states that it happens often and happens on multiple workstations.

I'll do some testing with this and see if I can figure out what the hang up is and the best way to prevent it.

This ticket should go to the Medical Imaging team since they own Dragon now. This will have to be discussed with Nuance and potentially Epic. It can also be researched at TSG with the SA/Medical Imaging teams.

This workflow worked prior to the upgrade so it is likely not a Dragon issue but an Epic issue or some other system that changed with the upgrade.

Good Morning Cindy,

They say the program will lock up and kick them out frequently. The contact for the issue is Jenny Mullins at 981-8951.

Thanks

Received email below from Livia,

It is not showing up in his in-basket to cosign.  It is showing in the encounter on the note it still needs to be cosigned.

Thank you!
08/25/17 10:58:58 US/Eastern (STKELLEY):
Good morning Livia,

We received your ticket for Erin Berry about the chart not showing up for Dr. John to cosign but we need a bit more information before we can escalate this. Did he not get an inbasket message? Is it possible it was sent to the wrong provider? Also, where is it showing that it still needs to be cosigned?  If we can get all of this information it will be easier for us to know which team to send this to.

Thank you!","","","",""

The buckets do not drop correctly when you initiate billing. Barbara Boatwright was involved in setting this up in the past.  When you initiate the bill, it supposed to make a 121 bucket, a 131 bucket, and a 111 bill.  It is putting the room charges on the 121 bill which is incorrect.

Walked thru HAR in PRD since SUP did not copy last night.  Followed step in A/B Rebill documentation and user did everything correct so far but I am stuck on CMG 156;G which pulls the charges to the claim.  There is a complex LPP in that CMG that Epic wrote and this may have broken with v2017.  Opening SLG.

Hi Angelia,
I'm opening a ticket with Epic to take a look at a ""programming point"" that is used to pull charges to the claims for the A/B rebill.  This may have broken with the upgrade.  I will get back to you asap.

This seems to have changed with this in the last few days.

This is making it very difficult for reading these all day long spending most of the time selecting the same option everytime he clicks to a different frame.  It is not keeping the selection to turn off loop.

All the frames he looks at are opening with the cine loop on and it used to default with it off so it loaded quicker and more efficient to look at.

Checking if this is an option to add this selection or if not, if there is a different defined workflow for client.  Checking workflow if they should just select remove to put case back in depot then reschedule as during testing it seems that when I select either remove case or bump case it appears to do the same thing..

Dr. Barnhart,

I wanted to send a quick update in an email.  I tried to call but was unable to get through to you at the office.  The note that you have in question has some unfinished “wildcare” fields (***).  Below is a screenshot of where they are in the note.  It is not in patient instructions but in your actual note.  It’s under the Social Screening part of the note.  After you complete those fields, you should be able to sign/complete the note/visit.

Let me know if you are still having issues.

When she posted the cash payment, she put the total amount due in the followup acute, then put in the amount in cash and the remaining card amounts. There was a change in how she wanted to do it, so she refunded all three methods to repost them. She then posted the entire due in cash, prepay total shows as $123 but it's not actually due, the total due is $108 and she paid $108, but because of this it's now showing she owes $15 and she doesn't want the patient to get billed for no reason.

I called up customer to assist her and she was so abusive:
1. As soon as she picked up the phone she said she could not hear me so I needed to give the phone to an American so she could talk to that person - I thought my line was bad, so I told her to give me a moment to call her back.

2. I called her back, she picked up then hanged up on me

3. I called her back again and asked her if she could explain the problem further to me so I could see how best I could help her then she started being rude and shouting that if someone said they could not login it means they could not login and that what more did I need to hear.

4. She added that I should either change her username or password for her to login...then abusively that ""that is all I need from you"" ""you claim you offer professional service, so where is the professional service...""

5. I tried to calm her down, and asked her to give me a while to change her password for her

6. While I was working through the system she kept abusing me in the background ... I did not interrupt her

7. While I was just about to change the password, she said this was taking too long then hanged up on me again

8. I did not call her back again, because I knew she was agitated about something, I did not want to engage her any further.

9. Hopefully when she is calm enough we can talk through this one more time.

I think I know how you can edit these.  From your Cosign Charts folder, click on the message and then the button you want to click is Encounter.  There is no Edit button.  If it prompts you for Addendum then click Create Addendum.  Then just go to the Notes section and click the Addend button under the Resident's name.
See if that might fix the issue you were having and let me know if it's resolved.  Give me a call if you're still not able to edit.

Sent the following email to Wendi Lewis requesting her to contact Patricia Devins; need her approval to change fax number.
An Incident ticket (#399760) was created by Patricia Devins this morning due to Place of Service (POS) having the wrong fax number where she is unable to close a referral on a patient.

Patricia Devin created Interaction SD864625/C1213565 for the new POS 20258 Centra Lynchburg General Hospital – Inpatient.  Her request noted the fax number as 434-200-1550.

Another request for the same POS was created by Donna Hampton SD863922 / C1213428 that included fax number 434-200-7346.

We closed SD864625 as duplicate of SD863922 so the fax number in PRD is the one provided by Donna Hampton.

Patricia stated this is wrong fax number for this POS.

Please contact Patricia at 276-670-3326 to confirm changing the fax number and I’ll make this a priority for this morning.

Cheri Hartman put in a charge for this patient on 8/11/17 and it was a phone encounter. Because she was billed a G9012  for Care Coordination The care coordination charges needs to be Medicaid and can't be billed G9012. Charges should not have been billed since the insurance is not Medicaid and patient should not be charged.

The charge is showing that it is attached to the patient's Medicare however  I am unable to complete the MSPQ because there is not an appointment showing to be able to do the MSPQ and I am unable to remove it from my claim edit wq.

I spoke with Laurie.  The provider asked to have the Medicare annual at the same time as the 6 month follow up.  There wasn't enough time in the visit to do the Medicare piece.  But she never told the front desk to change the visit type back to FollowUp/Acute.  Charges were only dropped for the followup.  Now it looks like the patient had her Medicare Annual, but she did not.  This will cause a scheduling issue.  I'll have to wait until tomorrow once EOD runs to see if I can change this.

**The functionality for posting adjustments at claims acceptance, rather than at remittance posting was put into PRD on 8.10.17, so I'm not aware of any reason why these adjustments started qualifying for BWQ 3177 on 8.4.17.  I reviewed my incident spreadsheet & do not see any changes to the RMC immediately prior to that date.

The logic for BWQ 3177 - HO INSURANCE ADJUSTMENTS TIER 1 includes:
- Hospice account class
- Adjustments not approved by Level 1
- Adjustments made on Insurance buckets
- Adjustments not posted by user HB, BACKGROUND
- Adjustments between -$100.00 - $100.00

I have reviewed a couple of the charge sessions in BWQ 3177,  paying closer attention to the Adjustment Source.

1. Session 187888587 - Kafley, Bachi
HAR62310000306
-$403.26
 adj source = Post Adjustment - Account Maintenance

2. Session 187958255 - Via, William
HAR7309072
$2527.04
adj source = Adjustment Posting

Are you stating that one of these types of adjustments do not need to be reviewed?
