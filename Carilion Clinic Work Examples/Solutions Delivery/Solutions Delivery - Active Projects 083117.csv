Below are RFC's that are closed and related to this main project.

1.	C1063252  Radiologist need the ability to add Bi-Rads within PS-360.
a.	Lisa A said that she has made some progress but it is unfortunately going to be a slow process because the radiologists decided they want to do a standard template for all screening mammo studies that would fall in that Bi-Rads 0-2 range to make it more consistent and efficient.
b.	Spoke breifly with Sonya on what is needed as far as the key phrase.  Basically something that is for the Bi-rad code and density.
c.	We need a key phrase in the body.  Integration searches for Bi-rads category 1 grabs the 1st value put a space bar behind the word/number.  A key phrase is in the autotext and wouldn't be in another report. Example for density, perhaps breast density
2.	C1063255 Read multiple studies in PS-360


3.	C1065550 Please map the fluoro time answer located in the radiant end exam contrast/fluoro questionaire in the radinat end exam navigator to Powerscribe
a.	Please map the answer total flouro time answer locatied in the fluoro/cine documentation flow sheet for Intervential radiology to powerscribe.
b.	Benefit / Value:
i.	conpliant with PQRS requirement

4.	C1081725 Peer reivew will be part of the 3.0 upgrade as far as purchasing.  We will not configure or do anything specific to Peer Reivew until the upgrade has been completed.

5.	C1090853 Need to upgrade PS 360 to 3.0 for new enhancements and bug fixes.
a.	Contacted Chuck Perterson for docuemnts and to see if PopwerScribe has any new things that will be introduced in the near future.  I also had AJ to contact Sectra, they will be doing dose tracking and advance features are coming after the RMH Go-live but that should not affect PowerScribe.
b.	I also contacted Nuance and their responds was that Nuance does not perform qualifications on Integrations.  It is up to the Client to confirm with the Vendor that their specific version of the vendor product is supported with their version of PowerScribe 360/Reporting.  That being said, they do not have any known issues with Sectra

6.	C1094760 Please create the below teaching fields in PowerScribe and map them to the correct reporting fields in epic.
a.	Powerscribe teaching fields addition. We would like to add 2 'Teaching' field codes to powerscribe to track laterality errors in dictation. 'Teaching:K'  would be noted as 5a- Discrepancy in laterality- unlikely to be clinically significant. 'Teaching:S'  would be noted as 5b- Discrepancy in laterality- likely to be clinically significant.

Email from Tara Wiedeman:
At different times, for projects such as Epic, we’ve been asked to consider the use of technology as a way to provide training to our employees without relying on classroom or online learning.

We are requesting a virtual classroom that will allow us the opportunity to provide more robust training to our employees and leaders but doesn’t require us to rely on physical classroom space.

We would like this virtual classroom as a training option for the upcoming Kronos training that we are developing.  If we had this technology, we could have just a few master trainers (training remotely) that could facilitate multiple virtual classrooms across the organization.

Without the virtual classroom, we would need more trainers and more physical classroom spaces to accommodate the Kronos training for employees and leaders.

I’m happy to discuss in more detail.  Please let me know next steps and what other information you may need to move forward.  I will put in the PRF so that you can reference.

Thanks!

Anne M. Brown, Ph.D., is working with Drs. Trinkle and Bankole to submit a RAP grant for approval:
=========================================
Brief summary --

Two of my students won the Global Health Hackathon sponsored by Carilion Clinic in Spring 2016. The winning app proposed to be a platform for mental health/cognition assessment to be taken in real time/real environment by individuals on smart devices as ""prescribed"" by a physician. Carilion would like to see what having this app piloted would look like. By having individuals answer questions (even taking already validated exams like MoCA) relevant to mental health/cognition in real time, more insight and data could be provided to a physician to better understand an individual's baseline and how events affect scores and (hypothesized) aid in physician diagnosis.  The RAP grant that is in preparation would be the pilot study to test this app, relevant to mild cognitive impairment (comparing to MoCA). The study is looking to better understand usability by both patient and physician, usage of digital platforms to test cognition (vs pen and paper test), and test out the flow of information relevant to collecting data on patients in this way and integrating that into an EMR.
=========================================
Keith, Barbara, Dr. Morgan, Dr, Speaker, Vicki R. and Ashley Quick met with Anne Brown and her team on Thu Nov 10 to review.

There would be two phases:

phase 1- The physician would access the patient record in the DESA application using a secure link from Epic that identifies the patient by the unique ID created in Epic.

phase 2 - The DESA application would send back discrete values to Epic.","VJRIGGINS","1500","INNOVATION","YES","INTAKEPROCESS","0","2 - HIGH","EPIC (CACHE)","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

Improving Hybrid OR workflow
Provide clinical and/or financial background information pertinent to the business need:
Currently there are two encounters created for certain cases in Hybrid OR. For TAVR cases, one Cath Lab and one OpTime encounter is created and procedure is documented in both encounters. It would be beneficial for number of reasons to combine two encounters into one case where documentation can be shared between Cupid and OpTime. Supplies from the Cath Lab/CS OR/Vas OR are used and sometimes this can create challenges with supply ordering and charging. It is hard to tell what charges are captured by Vas OR and what should be charged by the CathLab. This could potentially cause loss in revenue or overcharges.
Similar challenges present with EP workflows.

The organization currently has no way of knowing what improvement projects are currently being worked on, nor what strategic goals the projects align to.  Thus, as an organization we may dedicate resources to solving a problem that does little or nothing to advance the organization's strategic goals.  The software also provides the ability to load continuous improvement frameworks/methodologies.  This facilitates the efficient and effective execution of an improvement project.

Software or Application: SYNGO DYNAMICS

Requested By Date: 00:00:00

Description:
SITUATION
The Siemens Syngo Dynamics (sD) Cardiology archive, ProStor InfiniVault, current state:
•	Supported 1TB tape cartridge capacity has been reached.
•	The 1TB tapes cartridges are being replaced with 2TB tapes (not an officially supported version).
•	Both the primary and secondary archive resides in the same location.  Thus, based on our IBM Business Resiliency program the InfiniVault cannot be used in an active recovery environment.

BACKGROUND
•	The Siemens sD cardiovascular studies were originally slated to be migrated to the Vendor Neutral Archive (VNA).  But, the migration was postponed due to Siemens’ proprietary annotation storage process.  If migrated in this state, clinicians could not view annotations via the enterprise viewer.  They would only be accessible within the sD application.
•	We are currently in the process of upgrading sD.  Once the upgrade is complete, any newly acquired images will store annotations in a standard format.

ASSESSMENT
•	We need to replace or upgrade the InfiniVault system. The decision will affect the storage and retrieval processes to allow for industry standard communication protocols and the ability to integrate the mandatory IBM Resiliency program.

RECOMMENDATION
1.	Our recommendation is to decommission the InfiniVault archive and migrate / store the data on the VNA.  This will provide seamless integration with the IBM Resiliency program. By doing so, it will also allow all referring clinicians the ability to view cardiovascular images, to include annotations, within EPIC Chart Review with the EPIC link.  Estimated cost would be $420k.
2.	Alternative – Continue replacing the 1TB tape cartridges with 2TB tapes.  At our current burn-rate, we estimate capacity would be reached within 40 months.
a.	Risks include:
i.	Inability to recover the archive from the secondary datacenter.
ii.	The 2TB cartridges are not officially supported by the vendor.
iii.	Future migration costs will rise as there will be more studies on the InfiniVault to migrate.

Per Elaine Sullivan (TSG Financial Advisor), the costs to migrate sD images to the VNA would be an operational expense.  Also, since this is an enterprise application, it should be covered under a TSG cost center.","TRSTUCKEY","3000","CONNECTED, CONVENIENT, COLLABORATIVE CARE","YES","LLWALKIEWICZ","0","","SYNGO DYNAMICS","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

Provide a short description of the business issue or need you are trying to address:
The requested by date is arbitrary.  As a part of the growth of Carilion Clinic and the increasing volume and capacity year over year, we plan on implementing TeleTracking at each clinic in phased approaches so we can more accurately measure throughput and placements.  The first clinic in the phase is Stonewall Jackson, followed by Franklin (SD824734).  At Stonewall, the plan will be to implement TeleTracking in the same fashion as it is at both RMH and NRV.  We would like to have bedboards on units, EVS and transport capability, and the ability to track patients from entrance to exit the same as RMH and NRV.
Provide clinical and/or financial background information pertinent to the business need:
This will provide better oversight of patient movement through Stonewall Jackson for patient safety.  It will also be able to provide insight into utilization of beds and types of patients that are admitted or denied so we can better maximize the resources in place and potentially alter the resources depending on statistics we are able to pull from TeleTracking.

Benefit / Value: 
There's currently a process in place when a patient is treated in the Emergency Room, the physician oncall is supposed to enter a note in EPIC which provides guidance to the schedulers on how to schedule the patient's Ortho appointment when they call in the next day.   Not all of the providers are good about entering the documentation that is needed.  If the documentation isn't in EPIC, the scheduler has to connect the patient to the advice line nurse for triage.  That results in an extra transfer for the patient and they have to give all of their information again.   Enabling CRM will allow us to be able to track the instances where the documentation was not entered so we can report on it and address the missing documentation.  This will ultimately create a much better experience for the patient and allow us to appropriately schedule without having to utilize an expensive resource like a nurse.","TJNERENBERG","240","CONNECTED, CONVENIENT, COLLABORATIVE CARE","YES","INTAKEPROCESS","0","","EPIC CADENCE","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

Solutions Delivery
------------------------
Request to perform research, analysis, and eventually implementation of I2B2 using technology resources.  This project will likely require involvement from multiple teams to build I2B2 servers from (likely) RedHat Linux using LAMP stack on virtual machine.  Implementation of I2B2 Shrine server with Programming/Web services.  Database will (likely) be running on Oracle and EDW team involvement for model, design, and ETL development.

You are correct. The OMOP vs i2b2 model was the desire of the CTSA grant participants. For the OMOP model, we would build extracts to i2b2 vs using the Caboodle i2b2 extracts.

Patrick and I have discussed and our assumptions for the scope are:
•	operationalization of i2b2 by setting up a test environment in preparation for production readiness
•	use of the OMOP data model
•	initial concentration on one domain (e.g., procedures, diagnoses, etc.)

For a test environment, we are aware of participation from at least the following teams to build and support an operational i2b2 environment:

i2b2 database - DBA team (Oracle)/Unix Team (AIX)
ETL processes - EDW team
i2b2 application - HA_Research_Team; Virtualization Team (VM); Programming Web Team
i2b2 workbench client - System Analyst Team

To implement the above, we will need:
- gathering and documentation of requirements - business analyst
- orchestration of project - project manager
- timelines and milestones defined by project team

We estimated 1600 hours of technical resource hours for the i2b2 model for the CTSA grant and we believe we can accomplish OMOP in this timeframe with a limited domain. If this is giving priority, then the EDW team would need to put a hold on other lower priority requests.","POSPARKS","1600","INNOVATION","YES","INTAKEPROCESS","0","3 - MEDIUM","EPIC COGITO DW","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

Subject: RE: CardioVascular Program Management Oversight Committee Meeting - 6/14/17 Meeting Notes

Hello all,

I wanted to provide some detail that may be helpful on this project.  Cardiolab has been put into Strata; however, I am awaiting capital approval.  I  did request TSG as part of the implementation process in the Strata request, so once approved by the capital/board that ball is set to start rolling as part of the Strata process.
Cardiolab is part of a bigger project (building a new EP lab to replace one of the existing ones-moving it to a different location [inside the cath lab]) which has been blessed by senior leadership, but also pending final approval in Strata to be able to cut a PO for the imaging equipment.  TSG (as well as other depts) is a part of that request as well.  The install of the Cardiolab equipment should line up with the completion of the new EP lab.  I currently have a total of three EP labs and with the replacement lab, we want to also switch recording systems in the existing (other 2 labs).  This is because I can't run two different recording systems in different labs without it posing by a patient safety concern from the end user perspective (different systems) as well as it would create different workflows for both staff and IT.  Replacing all three recording systems at once is the right thing to do.  The anticipated timeline for the construction on the room being completed is the end of February with vendor install starting in March 2018.

The vendor, 3M, is on the threshold of shifting their architecture for the 3M Encoder installation which will significantly impact the configuration as it stands at Carilion.  This would have consequences for 3M Encoder as installed and integrated with Epic, as installed in ""Stand Alone"" mode, and as installed and integrated with ClinTrac.  Kevin Zeitz can give a very eloquent synopsis of the way 3M Encoder has been installed and updated (quarterly, sometimes more frequently) historically as well as the ramifications of the imminent change.

In order to avoid the consequences of this change in architecture, we have the option of installing the ""WebCRS"" version which will simplify our installation and maintenance at Carilion going forward, negate the diffiuclties of trying to proceed with the conventional version, and is ultimately what 3M will force us to do anyway.

We request that this RFC be approved and routed to the Solutions Delivery Nonclinical assignment group and implemented with Administrative Applications assignment group resources.  We request that this be prioritized as a Critical so that we can start work on this immediately.

There will need to be assistance from server and networking resources at a minimum and we roughly estimate the level of effort to be 40 to 60 hours.  This Web verision will actually be installed locally and can be installed on virtual machine(s).

Provide a short description of the business issue or need you are trying to address:
The IRB is currently still in a paper-based system and we are planning to move to an electronic submission system that would encompass the entire research review process. We are proposing to use the iMedRIS system for this purpose.
Provide clinical and/or financial background information pertinent to the business need:
Human subjects research is submitted, approved, and tracked by the IRB. An electronic system is needed for the research community to have a more seamless submission system, and for the IRB to more efficiently manage the submission workload.
Compliance:  An e-system would greatly assist with ensuring regulatory compliance.  Documents and correspondence are currently being stored in a paper file and in an e-file on IRB shared drive, and study information is input by IRB staff into an outdated and bare bones Access database.  An e-system would remove duplication and chance for error on the both the IRB and investigator end, as the most recent documents would automatically be stored in the e-system.  Any member of the research team would be able to log in and find the most recent versions of their approved study documents. An e-system would greatly simplify the process for documenting investigator and IRB compliance with regulatory requirements, as these requirements would be built into the review and approval process rather than IRB staff and IRB members completing separate checklists that have to be scanned and uploaded into the shared drive.  In addition, an e-system time stamps all actions so that the timeline of a study would be documented, as well as the person completing the action.  An e-system would permit the running queries for studies that place the organization at the highest risk (vulnerable populations or investigator-initiated investigational new drug studies) so that additional attention can be given to those studies.
Convenience and ease of use: An e-system would allow researchers to submit applications from anywhere and be able to easily track the status of their submission in the review process.  It would also permit the various sign offs  levels to happen remotely or on their own time.
Turnaround times:  Researchers will likely respond to queries more quickly because they would not have to have access to their paper submissions. Triage on the IRB side will be a quicker process as the information will not have to logged into a database, CITI training will not have to be verified since it will be stored in the system, and the approval process will be automated. All these factors, along with other reduced administrative burdens, will contribute to reduced turnaround times.
Reporting: An e-system would allow for better and simplified tracking on turnaround times for submissions to determine which areas the IRB needs to improve and the areas where more investigator education is needed.   In addition, it would permit tracking of turnaround times for actions other than new study approvals, which is currently not possible in the Access database.  Running any reports from the current database is a cumbersome and challenging process which only yields minimal information.  This would be automated with an e-system.
Administrative burden of study files:  In order to maintain paper files, time is spent printing out documents if received electronically, or scanning documents to the e-file and for IRB members if delivered in paper format to the IRB.  IRB resources are used for printing and delivering packets.  In an e-system, the investigators would be responsible for uploading all documents into the system and there would be no printing or creating paper files.  All members would access the documents through the e-system.  All transactions for a study would be in one place and the timeline will be clearly displayed. In addition, it would simplify the process of creating and editing full board meeting agendas, as this could be done seamlessly through the e-system and the most up-to-date information would always be available to all IRB staff and IRB reviewer.
Administrative burden of email reminders: All approved studies receive two continuing review reminders at 30 and 60 days before expiration.  If the study expires, and expiration notice is also sent.  This is a manual process where a report is run in Access on a routine basis, then emails drafted and sent to the PI of those studies.  This process would be automated by an e-system and eliminate a huge administrative burden.
Administrative burden of processing documents: Once studies are approved, there is a manual electronic stamping process of consent documents and recruitment materials done by the IRB staff. These documents are then emailed to the PI along with their approval letter. The process of stamping and sending approval letters would be mostly automated through the use of an e-system.
System sustainability: The current Access database system version is no longer supported and is not sustainable.

  What dollar amount are you requesting? 25000
  What would the annual operating cost be? 21000
  How many net new FTEs would be required for this solution? .5 for initial implementation
Would there be any cost savings associated with this request? Yes
  Provide a descritpion of the cost savings:
Paper and administrative costs will be reduced. The main cost savings is that IRB staff could focus on issues that are more important rather than on administrative tasks.  The workflow for research will be more seamless, which will result in less wasted administrative time on the end of the researchers.
Data stored on this system will not be PHI or FERPA. It will be research protocols, supporting documents,  and related administrative documents only.
