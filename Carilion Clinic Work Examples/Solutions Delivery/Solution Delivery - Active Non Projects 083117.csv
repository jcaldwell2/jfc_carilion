The current process involves a significant amount of TSG and client intervention to separate out txns subject to underwriting. The txns submit to underwriting must be deleted before the remaining txns are released and updated in Lawson. There are also formatting issues with the file after txns subject to underwriting are released. The time required jeopardizes the timely release of txns to Lawson.

***
Debbie Rucker, Krista Coleman and Mabel Jones have researched the issue and propose the following build be put in place to handle new workflow:

High Level Plan: (Proposed Workflow):
When Provider places orders on a patient during the Inpatient Discharge process (Discharge Navigator),
order needs to follow a AMB workflow. Any lab order placed during discharge would need to default to Status of ""Future"". In order for lab to release order and process as an AMB order, the InPatient rule would need to be modified to force the order to AMB. By modifying the IP rule to look at all lab order types (Chemistry, Hematology etc.), and status of Future this can be accomplished. Lab order will then be sent to InBasket pool created by AMB. AMB rule will be modified to funnel orders to new department that is created for these discharge lab orders. When CCL service center staff logs into Epic, the IB pool is attached and they can access orders. CCL process will be the same as any existing AMB workflow which includes Quest billing from this point forward. For resutls from this department, they will need to be routed to the Ordering Provider.
TASKS:

To have the InPatient orders rule and Ambulatory rule reviewed to determine where additions can be made to improve order process upon patient discharge.

I looked this over with Taylor and it's possible.
Situation: When using the ""write Note feature on Canto the default encounter type is a telephone encounter. Since this is the case Epic requires a reson for call and the encounter stays open. Taylor and I played around with the idea of creating another encounter type that is a duplicate of the Miscell. Charting encounter, which would have no encoutner requirements, and renaming it to something like ""Haiku/Canto Note"" Haiku/ or ""Canto Encounter"", or something like that.

This would accomplish a couple of things:
1.When making a note with Haiku or Canto, there would be no encounter requirements and the encounters could be closed right from the inbasket after arriving in the My Open Encounters folder (already falls to this folder,  just tough to finsh since there is a ""reason for call"" encounter requirement not complete).
2. Clear documentation type in Chart review in the Encounters/Notes Tab. Currently it says telephone encounter.

The purpose of this project is to develop a process for adding the original pathology order number in CoPath so that the results link back to the original order in EPIC so that an additional order is not created.

The current process causes confusion for providers because the results are under a different order number than the original order.  Also, the original order remains incomplete in EPIC because no results ever post back to it.  This should eliminate these problems.

The EPIC Care Ambulatory team is currently rebuilding the EPIC Lab requisiton as a Rich Text document because of issues that occurred after the EPIC 2015 upgrade.  We've requested that the EPIC order number be barcoded on the lab requisiton, and we've been told that this can occur now since the lab reqs will be rich text, and this work will be included as a part of the req rebuild, and rolled out with the newly rebuilt rich text requisitions.  I was told that the barcoded EPIC Order number can only be added to a RICH text document.  I'm not sure if the EPIC Inpatient team had to rebuild the Inpatient lab req, but if so, can we do the same for the Inpatient requisition?

 NW: New Orders

Context

The interface doesn't accept NW messages containing a status of X in the Result Status field (OBR-25). Additionally,

         The Order Control field (ORC-1) must contain NW.

         The Placer Order Number fields (ORC-2 and OBR-2) should be null.

         The Universal Service ID field (OBR-4) must contain an ID mapped to a procedure record.

         The Result Status field (OBR-25) can be either null I, R or O (I, R, and O map to In Process).

Workflow

Complete the following steps to verify that this interface creates a new order after receiving an NW message:

1.     Log in to your test environment.

2.     Submit a send number ""NW"" message to this interface.

3.     Open the patient chart and validate that the order appears in Chart Review.

Ragan뭩 response relates to our conversation on Wednesday.
It would be helpful to understand how this will be used in Care Coordinator Workflows as there is probably a more efficient solution that could be added in addition to (or instead of)  the small display in the banner i.e. appointment columns, registry reports, larger in-chart displays.

Hi Jason,
We plan to use snapshot for the HMM =NGACO and this will be available as soon as we tag all of the pts with CMS  alignment file in January.

In our present configuration, I understand Carilion has exposed all  HMM in the pt banner for clinical users. Yet,  if the patient has more than one HMM the physician must click on the divit. That  is  problematic because they must do something to see the indicator.  Perhaps there is a way to for  priority for HMM so it is always the first one thus it will display?

This is not something we need and answer to now, it just came up in conversation yesterday while in the Steering team meeting with  Dr Jeremiah.

Looking forward to start working on this and other areas with you  guys.

Per Steven Nape on 2/2/2017:
Please update my original request with the following information discussed on 1/18/2017 between Steven Nape and Jason Wright:
Description:
-	Write a new sql table and use appropriate queries to generate desired reports.  For now, the table will likely just capture data for use next year in 2018, but the sooner we can start collecting the relevant data, the sooner we can start to automate the year-to-date comparison reports that we are presently using a manual process to produce. In addition, once the table exists, we can also write queries to do some internal validation of our database which is in need of some clean-up.  Define what data need to go in to the table and will need a resource with writing the necessary queries.  Objective is to replace all existing databases formerly created by Howard Ballintine (former JCHS employee).  -	Added to RFC C1169498 2/2/2017

Affiliated With: JCHS
Details:
I am requesting to create a data warehouse extracting data from Power Campus.  The data will primarily be student data and will be used to create date-to-date comparisons of the various data points in the warehouse. I have worked on creating data warehouses personally and can help map out exactly how the data warehouse would be most useful.

Requested By Date: 03/01/17 00:00:00

I'm not sure if you are able to see the Cupid documentation, but the Cath Log does reflect the location as Hybrid. Based on previous Finance instructions, when the cath lab staff are the only ones on the procedure, the documentation will be by Cath Lab staff in Cupid w/billing being under Cath Lab and Finance will route revenue back to Hybrid for the use of the room as needed. I don't believe this has been established as a final policy due to the fact that we are still working on refining a process for these types of cases, but that was the most recent instruction I have.
i am requesting IF it can be done, to interface Cupid and Radiant with EPIC

These transactions need to be sent to 3M 360 Encompass and ClinTrac systems.  Per 3M, the 3M systems need to receive A41 or A44 transactions to combine duplicate accounts.

They are not using the MAR at this time.  Billing(Barbara Boatwright)  has stated that the Admin amt and Units must be entered in addition to the NDC.  These need to be a hard stop but only for Cardiology Rke Tests.
In order to do this the following build must occur:
Duplicate Navigator Topic TOPIC_WS_AMB_DISCHARGE
Duplicate Navigator Template:  T_WS_AMB_DISCHARGE
Duplicate Navigator Configuration record: 2100000003 AMB CHARGE CAPTURE
On the duplicate VCN need to enter NDC at the top section (remove from the bottom section first) and make it Required
On the duplicated Topic enter the duplicated VCN in the Configuration column
Enter the duplicated Topic into the duplicated Template on the Left Pane
On the Workflow Engine Rule, enter the duplicated Template on the Navigator Overrides for Wrap-up (replace T_WS_AMB_DISCHARGE with the duplicated Template)

It doesn't appear that making the NDC required also makes the Unit and Qty required and have made Barbara aware of this.  Have reached out to Cardiology (Brenda Mccullough) to have them start entering Unit and Qty.  Barbara said that they aren't always entering the NDC, hence why we need to make at least the NDC required.

Can research to see if there's another way to make the Unit and Qty reauired

Background: The initial lactate has to be drawn within 3hrs from time of identification (which for core measure is the time the last criteria is in the chart, even if we don't recognize that). The repeat has to be drawn within 6hrs of the time of identification if the first was >2.

Assessment: This brings up the issue of how to direct the timing of the second lactate. We potentially have 3 hour window from time of first draw to time of second draw to assure we obtain it within the 6 hour window. This is problematic if ordering a reflex lactate, less so if two are ordered and Epic cancels one if the first is not elevated.

Request: Create a special order in Epic for ""lactate with repeat in 4 hours"". If the first is resulted in Sunquest as normal (<2.0), Epic automatically cancels the order for the second lactate.

2) Notes do not always attach to pregnancy episode.
3) Management needs correct visit type to track statistics.

Recommendations for OB GYN Jefferson and OB GYN Highland sites:
1) Create ""OB Preop"" visit type which attaches OB navigator with 30 minute allocation.
1) Leave current Preop (1430) attached to GYN navigator, but change from 15 minutes to 45 minute allocation.
3) Leave complex procedure (15583) attached to GYN navigator with current 45 minute allocation.  Use for LEEP and Endosee.
4) Leave GYN procedure (15584) attached to GYN navigator, but change from 45 minute allocation to 30 minute allocation.  Use for colpo.
5) Create ""OB Procedure""  with an OB navigator attached with 30 minute allocation. Use for pregnancy NSTs.

At that time, capabilities were shared and Kevin and I (Jeff Echternach) agreed that we would submit a new request and move forward with an implementation once the UM Department was ready to take this on. That time has come. We would like to use the existing Fax Service programs that Kevin and his team at TSG Maintain. We would like to convert the existing UM/Care Management Fax Numbers to a Fax / Email solution.
Provide clinical and/or financial background information pertinent to the business need:
Utilizaiton Management is the concurrent, payor communication team for Carilion Medical Center and Carilion Tazewell Hospitals. This team receives hundreds of faxes per day, every day, from payers. These faxes are printed as per a typical fax receipt workflow, and then the paper faxes are distributed to our team members either in person, or electronically, by taking the faxed print out, placing it on the scanner, and transmitting the images over email to the appropriate Utilization Management Nurse. This time consuming, difficult workflow creates several problems for our department. Those problems include: Inefficiency, Lost Faxes (lost revenue), Inconsistent record keeping, and difficulty tracing the location of an original document (appeals/denials/issue resolution).

This request comes from an email requesting research for an issue where a Quest phlebotomist goes to collect a patient in the ED and then finds out the patient is actually in the ED beds located on 5E TCU. Based on the SQ label routing and workflow the system is working as it was originally set up to accommodate workflow at that time. The ED is a decentralized phlebotomy unit whereby the Carilion ED staff collects venipuncture blood specimen and send to the lab. If there are issues with the draw then they contact to lab to draw the patients. To make it work today there is logic on the Carilion Integration Engine and Sunquest to accommodate decentralized label printing.

Now there has been a decision within the Carilion ED and Quest whereby Quest Phlebotomy staff will collect venipuncture blood specimens and not Carilion ED staff. This will require work effort from the Epic ASAP team, Carilion Integration Engine team, Carilion Cardiovascular Lab team and Quest Lab IT team.

Dr. Hartman,
 
I wanted to follow-up with you regarding your question about Individual Service Plans, that I believe you indicated becomes effective 4/1. I reached out to the managers of the inpatient and ambulatory teams, since it appeared that these could be related to either area. I had found information at the following:
 
http://www.dss.virginia.gov/files/division/licensing/crf/intro_page/forms/all_other/032-04-0010-00-eng.pdf
 
https://userweb.epic.com/Thread/8813 is a potentially helpful thread in Epic.  (copied here for Dr. Speaker's benefit)
 
Neither manager had heard of it and suggested that you enter an optimization/enhancement request.
 
I'm not sure how that process works for physicians, so I have copied in Dr. Speaker for assistance. Ultimately, I think the request goes to his group to determine what is needed and identify the resources required.
 
I hope this information is helpful with getting your request moving forward to support your clinical documentation needs.
 
I'm sorry also that we were not able to discuss at the SBIRT follow-up meeting, but understand that you had a patient conflict, and hope that went as well as possible.
 
Thank you,
mattie

Migration project h","Lawson team needs to work Wells fargo to convert from DTS to SAFE Transmissions. Migration project has been given a start date of 3/27/17 and an end date of 6/5/17.

For the migration from DTS to SAFE-Transmission there are no file format changes for your files. The thing that will be changing will be how and where your logging in to send your files to the bank.

I뭗 like to first start by confirming a few quick things

1.       Here is the list of files that need to be migrated.  I need to verify that these are files you transmit.

UID           PRODUCT            Direction
217004   ACH (Payroll)       Inbound to the Bank
296607   ACH (Credit file)   Inbound to the Bank
330442   PMGR (pay           Inbound to the Bank

2.       Each UID currently uses SFTP with PGP as an added layer of protection. I뭭e listed the protocols  that SAFE-Transmission supports. We recommend staying with SFTP since it is the most secure and the PGP isn뭪 necessary unless it is your preference.

Please confirm what you뭗 like to use going forward.

Protocol
Authentication method
FTPS (SSL)
User ID, password, and digital certificate provided by Wells Fargo
SFTP (SSH)
User ID and key (preferred) or User ID and password
HTTPS
User ID, password, and digital certificate provided by Wells Fargo
FTP with PGP
User ID and password (requires encryption with PGP key)
AS2
User ID, password, and digital certificate.


3.       I need to confirm an Automated User Admin (this person will have admin responsibilities within Safe-Transmission and upload your key, download the banks and manage IP addresses) they also have to be set up with a user name, password and an RSA security token in CEO.

4.       Confirm who will be doing the testing for these files.  This can be the same person as the Automated User Admin or different.  This person doesn뭪 have to have credentials in the CEO portal and would be an approved person that can work with our Transmission Support team at any time.  I can also list multiple people for this position.

I attached a quick reference guide for SAFE-Transmission if you need it.  Let me know if you뭗 like the full version.  I am leaving it off since Harrison and Alex are already set up in SAFE-Transmission and I뭢 assuming are familiar with its functions.

Once we get this confirmed we can go more into how you want these files set up with the auto user.

Opening an RFC per Dr. Speaker so this work can be approved and prioritized.  Carilion will need to establish a tack force comprised of leadership representatives and application analysts from HB/PB, ADT/Prelude, IP, and AMB to develop implementation, training and communication plans to implement these changes.  These changes will impact registration, clinical documentation, PBAs, medication administration, and billing. Implementing these chanes will significantely improve Carilion's ability to provide quality and appropriate medical care to the LGBTIQ population; it will make clinical documentation easier, improve decision support, and increase patient satisfaction.

BACKGROUND (from release note)

All organizations that track the gender identity or sexual orientation of patients should validate the new category list items and train users to document this information in the new SmartForm or the collection method your organization currently uses.

To ensure that you can accurately and thoroughly collect patient information about gender identity and sexual orientation, we've created new SmartForm 40165-Sexuality and Gender Identity. The new SmartForm features the following new items, as well as several released SmartData Elements:

    Gender Identity (I EPT 131)
    Sexual Orientation (I EPT 132)
    Sex Assigned at Birth (I EPT 133)

The new Gender Identity (I EPT 131) and Sexual Orientation (I EPT 132) items use values based on Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) recommendations that can potentially meet future UDS reporting requirements. If needed, you can expand the list of values based on your organization's requirements. Note that the Sexual Orientation item is multiple response, allowing clinicians to have more complete documentation of the patient's identity if the patient identifies with multiple sexual orientations.

The new, more granular way of documenting gender, sex, and sex assigned at birth in SmartForm 40165 also enables clinicians to access obstetric documentation tools for patients who have a documented sex (I EPT 130) of Male, but who also have a sex other than Male documented for either gender identity or sex assigned at birth.

You can use SmartForm 40165 as released or copy and modify it in the SmartForm Designer. You can also modify existing SmartForms, flowsheets, registration and demographics forms, and other collection methods to include the new items.

Additionally, we created new rule property 19129-Patient Sex Cannot Be Reliably Determined. If you have decision support built around gender identity, sexual orientation, or sex assigned at birth information, you can use this new rule property in rules designed to trigger decision support activities such as BPAs. For more information, refer to the BestPractice Advisories Setup and Support Guide.","MTNULL","","","NO","","0","1 - CRITICAL","EPIC CARE INPATIENT","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

We have a serious issue related to HB electronic payments associated with Bad Debt accounts.  

Two situations occur when electronic files are processed in EPIC:
1) Payment will auto post to a clearing account
2) Payment will be reject because the remittance is out of balance, at this point the poster applies payment to the undistributed bucket to balance the remit as instructed by S Davis/TSG because the program will not let the payment be deleted from the file.  Once the undistributed bucket is worked the payment is sent to SCA/DRD.  We are not sure why some payments post to the clearing and others reject.

Description:
Amy LaHait, our new Ellucian Account executive visited the College earlier this year and one of the things we discussed is an Ellucian Audit of our current PowerCampus practices.  It has been at least 10 years since we conducted a thorough audit of any Setflow.  During this time we've upgraded many times without making any major changes in procedures and processes.  Amy followed-up with an estimate for auditing all PowerCampus Setflows (sent to Mike Womack).  At this time a complete audit may not be financially or operationally necessary.  Since we're working on a CRM solution for the Admissions Office and our Bursar뭩 Offices is relatively stable we believe our immediate need is auditing of the Academic Setflow (Registrar's Office). This area drives most of the student processes - registration, transcripts, room scheduling, course scheduling, catalog, academic calendar and many more.  The complexity and volume of work that is handled means that a vast majority of our PowerCampus issues come from this area.  Further, Linda Williams, our Registrar who set up the system in 2004 is retiring in May.  We have hired a new Registrar; however, she no PowerCampus experience (Banner user).  This is a perfect opportunity for us to fulfil two needs - auditing the Academic Setflow and training our new Registrar.  Scheduling this training in June or July would be perfect for the office.  I am requesting that you consider using any available Ellucian consulting dollars to move forward with researching and scheduling the audit/training.  This is a crucial time for the College and making this investment now will definitely save us time and money in the future.

Thanks you and please let me know if you have any questions.

Our dept is located at 1030 S. Jefferson St., Ste G101.
Countless times our patients have been misdirected to the hospital, and in some cases, even to the ED, by Carilion staff (pt access/registration, guest services, MOAs in other depts, etc.) unfamiliar with our actual location.
This is a significant pt dissatisfier as it creates a substantial inconvenience for patients as they end up making multiple stops, it delays pt care, and it disrupts other patient and staff schedules.
In addition, our dept also provides services in Franklin County at CFMH. Pts to be seen at this location are often told to come to Roanoke by the aforementioned Carilion staff. Our current dept name does not reflect the locations where our services are actually provided which also leads providers to believe that our services are not available to patients in the Franklin area.
Finally, the term ""DIABETIC ED"" does our patients a disservice as it indicates that we educate ""diabetics"" rather than acknowledging that our patients are first and foremost people, who also happen to have diabetes.
I submit that our dept name be changed to ""DIABETES MANAGEMENT ROANOKE/FRANKLIN"". I'm also open to reasonable alternatives.

Most registries utilize analytics reports that are generated using procedures or ICD9/10 codes. Reports are delivered using different frequency. Additional review is done and not all patients that are on the list will be included in the registry if the patient meets different exclusion criteria. Abstraction volumes are then documented in the Access database stored on the S. drive. 
Going forward I would like to replace some of these processes by utilizing Epic tools. I think it would be helpful to generate WB reports for the patients that meet inclusion criteria for the registry and once the chart is abstracted patients would be removed from the WB report. This could be done by documenting on the flowsheet which registry patient was included and if chart abstraction was completed. If answered 밳es or doesn뭪 meet inclusion criteria, then the patient would be removed from the list.

- Instead of the entire timer changing colors (yellow/red) have a box appear similar to vital signs timer
- Addition of ""Patient Sleeping"" and ""No needs at this time"" added to the patient representative rounding flowsheet
- Remove the patient rep rounding timer column from all EPIC profiles with the exception of the patient representatives and CRMH ED Leadership team.
- Remove the ""0"" for patients who are not in a room (see snapshot).  This is crowding the screen.

Wisdom is not currently equipped to funciton as a dental image PACS.  Wisdom relies on using links to another image storage solution much as Epic relies on links to Sovera for document image storage/display.

The Carilion dental clinics currently utilize Eaglesoft as their solution for practice management and dental PACS.

Initially anticipated milestones:
1) Evaluate Wisdom vs Eaglesoft from practice managment/documentation perspective, identify gaps, opportunities
2) Evaluate Sectra as the image storage/PACS solution in the context of Wisdom.  Consider Epic recommendations, Epic BLOB server, etc.
3) Evaluate prospect of migrating images currently stored in Eaglesoft to the Sectra PACS, migrating other patient record information/documentation from Eaglsoft to Wisdom.
4) Evaluate prospect of interfacing current imaging sensors in the dental clinics to the Sectra PACS vs. Eaglesoft.
5) Consider current evaluation of a solution for CNRV to support digital dental imaging.

This initiative will most likely involve input/participation from three vendors: Epic, Sectra, Patterson (Eaglesoft), and TSG teams including Imaging, Administrative Applications (Eaglesoft suppot), Field Support, Systems Engineering, Systems Analysts, Networking, and Integration.

Scenario --

IEAC: Inpatient cardiac patients sometimes need Cardiopulm Rehab.  (note - not all patients qualify for this)  Currently, Cardiopulm nurse have rounds at the hospital where they assess the patients.  Currently, when they do their assessment - if a patient qualifies for rehab, they inbasket Sybil Calhoun to get the patient scheduled....WITHOUT AN ORDER.  We need an order,  CMS needs an order - etc etc.

So, apparently the cardiac providers and attendings don't know which patients qualify for this service and which ones do not.  Therefore, they don't want to place a rehab order for every cardiac patient.  However, the order has to be placed prior to the discharge for the order to ""count"" for the action registry.  (we have not been getting credit for the services since they were not placing orders)

I am told that the providers have to go into the discharge navigator to place an outpatient order.  Apparently this is pretty tricky and they could accidentally trigger the patient discharge if they are not careful.

If the nurses who are rounding change their context, could the do an orders only encounter to place the rehab order?

I have the names of 2 nurses that we could test this on.  Thoughts?

Hello Marcus,

Most of us in my division use patient lists to manage patients (both inpatients and outpatients who need followup, procedures, etc.). I wonder if there is a way to add a column in patient lists that tells us when the patient was added to that specific list? Or alternatively, if there is a way one can type a note to oneself that could be displayed in the lists?

Thanks,
Mohammad

The goal is for these new order sets to function just like the one Pre-Op uses:  IP SUR:Pre-Procedural Order Set that gets launched by the RN upon the patient's arrival, and signed ""per protocol"" with the surgeon's name.
 
What steps need to be taken to accomplish this? So far, the order set is on paper and has been verbally agreed upon by the physicians.

Primary Contact: Marlene Perrott

Vendor initially notified JCHS about this transition via phone call and email on 11/21/2016.  No formal service request was submitted to TSG at that time pending confirmation of a target trasnsition date.

For planning purposes only, JCHS set a target transition date of 4/30/2017.  Kathy McNary, Sr.Client Relationship Manager for Credentials Solutions, in an email dated 11/21/16 informed JCHS, ""We do not have the exact start date for the conversions to begin; we have had a couple of BETA schools going through the process and we are making adjustments to the process to ensure a smooth transition for you."".

After numerous email communications and plan iterations, early in April 2017, the vendor announced they were postponing transition until June 2017, then later in May postponed the transition date again to be after their pilot release to selected schools - specific date TBD as of June 1, 2017

Description:
In November, 2016, Credentials Solutions, our vendor for 'Transcripts-On-Demand' announced their plan to transition their customers including Jefferson College to thier new product 'Transcript Plus'.  Next steps were pending more details from vendor regarding the impact and level of effort required from our customer and TSG resources for implementation.

In January, 2017, in compliance with PISO security requirements, a VRA (Vendor Risk Assessment ) was emailed from Beth Snead of PISO to vendor for completion.

As of June 1, 2017, VRA has not been completed, nor any feedback or ETA provided by vendor for completion.

Benefit / Value:
When providers write prescriptions that are not 90 days and put refills on them the pharmacy has to call to ask the provider if it is okay to fill for 90 days most often because it will save the patient money and time waiting for a response from the office.  If the check box is added then the pharmacist can fill for 90 days if it saves  the patient money.  Right now the process is receive the prescription, process through the insurance company to find out how it can be filled, contact the physician office if the patient wants it for 90 days, obtain approval, resend to the insurance company and then fill for the patient.  This box would cut of the phone call from the pharmacy to the office thus saving the patient and money.","DPFOSTER","","","NO","","0","","EPIC CARE AMBULATORY ","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

EAF 4106 also has logic in Item 75701.  We need logic from EAF 4106 to pull prior to logic at DEP.  The current logic looks at DEP first, then EAF. Therefore, the NPI on claims may be incorrect.

Provide a short description of the business issue or need you are trying to address:
Development of an appropriate and efficient HR reporting and analytics engine to reduce ad-hoc request volume, provide an appropriate self-service tool for HR business partners and other clients, and provide a user-driven solution platform from which to provide strategic dashboards and conduct advanced analyses. This solution would allow analysts and data consumers to reallocate time spent fulfilling data and analysis requests to more advanced analysis and consultative work of identifying root causes and interventions. HR business partners, analysts, and other customers lack tools that enable independent analysis.
Provide clinical and/or financial background information pertinent to the business need:
This platform will allow the organization to achieve strategic excellence by making data-driven HR and workforce decisions. This platform will provide the following capabilities among others: identification of factors contributing to turnover; insights to identify ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of recruiting; measure the employee lifecycle experience; and allow the better use of labor focusing on the issues impacting our workforce and less on the manual work of linking data sets and producing reports and visuals in Excel and other tools. HR employees will be able to spend more time of the value-added work of linking the employee experience to the patient experience and determining the ROI of targeted interventions.
What are you attempting to achieve and what benefits are you attempting to attain? Net new item
Has a product or vendor already been reviewed or selected? Yes
  Would there be an ongoing contract associated with this proposed solution? Yes
  Would this solution be purchased or leased? Purchased
  Would the solution be hosted offsite in the ""cloud""? No
  From what devices would the solution be accessed? Desktop and possibly mobile
  What other vendors were researched and considered for this solution? Tableau and SAP Lumira. PowerBI's integration with Microsoft Excel and other data tools, along with its familiar formula and query language sets it apart.

  Please provide the name of the selected vendor: Microsoft PowerBI
  Please provide the URL of the selected vendor's web site: https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/
Would this initiative replace an existing solution? No
  What is the solution being replaced? null
If this request is denied or delayed, what may happen as a result? HR will continue to lack an effective reporting and analytics engine to provide meaningful data and insights to business leaders driving business outcomes and effective change management. The organization will lag behind its peers in the ability to make data-based decisions about our talent in an increasing competitive landscape. An additional FTE may be needed to keep up with report development demand without the efficiencies gained by this software.
Who is your financial advisor? David Hagadorn
Have you discussed this solution with your financial advisor? No
  What dollar amount are you requesting? null
  What would the annual operating cost be? null
  How many net new FTEs would be required for this solution? null
Would there be any cost savings associated with this request? Yes

As part of the move of CTaC from RMH 1S to the Shenandoah Life building, a question has come up about the location of the four servers used for the RescueNet Suite of products used by CCPT dispatchers.  Specifically, the servers listed below are currently housed in the RMH 15th Floor server room.  The question is if they should be relocated to Shenandoah or moved to the TSG server farm on Kimball Ave.

In discussions between representatives of CCPT, CTaC, and TSG, the informal consensus is that all parties would best be served by moving the servers to Kimball Ave.  In order to do this however, it must be assured that sufficient network performance exists between Kimball and Shenandoah.  In essence, we need to confirm that functional performance as perceived the the CCPT dispatchers is not degraded by locating the servers at TSG instead of at the same physical location as the dispatch center (Shenandoah).  

Once confirmed, the plan for the server relocation will be included into the greater Shenandoah Life project.

The servers in question are:

For example a C4B deduction may take if an earnings code is associated with C4B and their is an active C4B deduction on bn32, but they may not be in employee group B-C4B.  Although the bn32 deduction should not be active, it is not necessarily stopped when an employee transfers.  We are working with Wells Fargo to change that.  However, the transmission file should not populate the status field with ACTV unless the employee is currently in that employee group.

Provide a short description of the business issue or need you are trying to address: 
Urology was acquired by Carilion in Sept 2014. Prior to that, our office used Allscripts EMR. At this point, Patterson Pope has performed two migrations working with Physician Discoveries, our previous billing and EMR support service, in an attempt to obtain our patient medical records . The files from the first migration were incomplete, and the files from  the second migration are so discombobulating that they are virtually useless.  Our office is still having to ask Physician Discoveries to send us records for the majority  of our Allscripts records requests . Doug Martin is familiar with every aspect of this from the beginning.. He suggested we submit an optimization to request a web based site be built for the Allscripts records . Please contact him with your questions: dlmartin@carilionclinic.org, 540-981-7200
Provide clinical and/or financial background information pertinent to the business need: 
I can't speak to the financial background as I have not been involved in that respect., but I do know it has been prohibitively expensive for Carilion to pay Physician Discoveries for  Allscripts access and to Patterson Pope for the migration.

The Buonopane Group pricing initiative is aligning our prices for facility inpatients and outpatients. This includes Carilion Clinic Cardiology (CCC). Currently, CCC has a separate fee schedule for facility charges with lower prices. All CCC services will be transitioned to the CMC fee schedule for both medications and procedures. Due to concerns of a drastic increase in cost for patients, discussions have occurred between OIC and Finance. OIC indicates that CCC procedures (echos, stress tests) can be priced at a higher charge for patients who present to the Emergency Department.

We are requesting that TSG research to see if it is possible for the ED to have a different fee schedule for CCC procedures performed in the ED (echos, stress tests). This involves research to check if pricing can be mapped to the department (ED) ordering the service versus the cost center linked to the staff performing the procedure (Home Department)).

If this testing is successful, a new fee schedule group needs established for the CMC ED for CCC testing procedures.

Pricing for CCC patients will pull from the CMC fee schedule to align with consistent outpatient pricing.  Establishment of an ED Fee Schedule with increased cost for ED patients who receive CCC testing procedures.

This is becoming more and more difficult with the hemodialysis patients but we also need for our contracted services (for peritoneal dialysis and apheresis) to be able to schedule electronically as well.

Need the Attached Word documents turned into Doc Flowsheets for the new Adult and Pediatric versions of the Intake Flowsheet.  
Please review with Hallee M. and Angie McFaddin, as we would like to incorporate as many CPM rows as possible.
We need all of the current Intake Flowsheets to be hidden, so staff may no longer select them and continue to document using the old versions.  These should be hidden:
-115: Intake Flowsheet
-584: Intake Flowsheet
-2100000325: Pediatric Intake Flowsheet
-2100000115: Pediatric Specialty Intake Flowsheet

We need the Ortho Intake Flowsheet (783) updated to include the new Adult Intake Flowsheet questions that are attached.  However, the Ortho Flowsheet should still start with the following sections that currently exist:
-General Information
-Details of Injury/Pain

A new Document Type called ""New Patient Packet"" is also needed, as the Front Desk staff will begin documenting this discreetly in the Documents Table when they have given it to the patient.

A report is also necessary so that nursing management/leaders can track how well their nursing staff are documenting the Rooming information.  This will also be beneficial to the Accreditation Readiness team as they work with departments.
The report should be broken down by department, and allow the manager to see the percent of completion of these flowsheets for their department based on their # of office visits per month.  The report will also need to break down to a completion per user, so they can follow up and provide re-education as needed.  In addition to the Flowsheet rows included, the report should also provide the % complete for Tobacco Status and Smokeless Tobacco documentation, as well as PHQ-9 documentation for their office visits.  

Jamie Akers has been in the loop from training, and already has several training points.  A mass education around Rooming will be developed which will need to include several education reminders around the entire Rooming process.

Benefit / Value: 
Due to variation in Ambulatory nurse rooming documentation, and the requirement for ""assessment"" which is out of the scope of CMA's who frequently do this work, we have worked with Ambulatory Nursing, Accreditation Readiness, and Quality to create a new Adult and Pediatric Intake Flowsheet.  This flowsheet ensures the documentation that is required every visit is at the beginning, while those that are only required for initial visits or when there are changes are documented as such, and do not require a patient assessment to determine.  The changes to this flowsheet are necessary for JC surveyable sites, but we would like to work with Ambulatory Nursing and training to standardize and implement in all Ambulatory practices, as our Ambulatory clinics are constantly placed on and off the surveyable list.  Additionally, several of these documentation requirements are for CMS and not just JC.  ","EHDEACON","","","NO","","0","","EPIC CARE AMBULATORY ","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

Please add the PCP_VISIT measure to the Aetna MA  plan. All current logic used for the UHC ACP population will remain the same, but we need to add this population.

Please build a new metric ""AWV"" for the UHC MAPCPI plan. The applicable CPT codes are: G0402, G0438, and G0439. Use the following guidelines: Compliant by Payor, Billed in Epic within 1/1/2017 - 12/31/2017, and lastly Documentation DOS within DOS Period (1/1/17-12/31/17).

Lastly, we need patients with two payors to show a ""Y"" in the ""More than 1 Payor?"" field, even when the patient does not have any applicable metrics under one payor. See examples: MPI 1477600 & MPI 2282871 previously discussed under ticket IM393391.

Business Need:
We need to have these items added to our current report in order to capture gaps in care that we are currently unaware of. If the worklist does not show the metrics and appropriate flags, then we will miss out on opportunity to bring those patients in or to remind the provider to order these items. Ultimately, this could impact our incentive opportunity if we do not meet our targets for the missing metrics.

Requested By Date: 08/21/17 00:00:00

Deadline Driver:
We would like to have these items added to the worklist as soon as possible, to make sure we are capturing as much opportunity as possible prior to the year end. We understand this may involve some additional build, so we have extended our ""need it yesterday"" time frame.

One of our initiatives is to have the Executive Dashboards on By Default with Epic 2017 so that when executives will have access to it immediately upon 2017 go-live. The executive dashboard was developed based on feedback we received from CEOs and COOs. Since CEOs and COOs do not log into Epic frequently, we expect that this web-based solution will make these dashboards more accessible.
     Since you already have EpicCare Link deployed, the Executive Dashboard should turn on automatically when you install a client pack after some additional setup on the cache side.

1. In EpicCare Link text, open EpicCare Link/PlanLink System Definitions. 
2.Go to the Authentication Methods screen.

All information on the list needs to be entered manually and can only be accessed on one computer. We would like to find a way to get this list into epic, which other hospitals with epic have successfully transitioned to. This would be a modification of a sign out used by other departments showing the information required on the list. 
It would be easier to show someone the list instead of attempting to describe it here. Whenever a patient delivers and then goes to postpartum the patient must then be manually transferred to another part of the list. 

We would like this list to be as similar to our current excel spreadsheet list but in epic with the ability to have data automatically transferred from epic as to prevent human error and time spent updating the list. 

I can attach a blank excel spreadsheet to this request for you to be able to see what information we request, although as the spreadsheet is blank it will not be fully clear which information we request to be in an epic version. The first 3 pages (labor and deliver, antepartum, and postpartum are used) the rest of the pages are no longer used

Benefit / Value: 
As this list is outside of epic requires a lot of effort and time is spent keeping this list up to date and has an increased chance for errors and omissions due to the complexity of upkeep on the list. Inputting patient information that could easily be auto added through epic will ensure that the patient list is up to date. Also due to the manual entry of the list there is the possibilities of patient omissions which would lead to the treatment team not being aware that the patient is currently admitted.

This will need to have a group review what is currently integrated and what the desired integration points are with Optime.  Additionally,  we would like to consider having Epic come on site to review current workflows vs foundation / best practices.  



Good morning, Steve.

The non-OR procedural areas and anesthesia have formed a working group to address the needs for integration of these procedures into the anesthesia schedule.  As background, interventional radiology, endoscopy, and electrophysiology, have grown and evolved as we have expanded capabilities and added subspecialized practitioners.  Along with this, the need for anesthesia to support complex cases in these areas has increased.  We are all working to find a solution for this issue.  We would like to explore the potential to post cases for these areas in OP Time so that they will be visible to the anesthesiologists as OR cases are.  This capability would solve several problems, not least among them the ability for anesthesia to see all the needs for the day and avoidance of procedure delays and cancellations.  In addition, this would allow the specialists in these area to continue working in the Epic designed workflows for their areas of expertise.  Please comment on this potential and options for this type of integration/credentials for practitioners in these areas.

Best,

Evelyn

See note below we received today. This is going to create another situation in which the MD has to sign for the ACP. Based on this we need to escalate looking at not requiring a co-signature on the ""clinical support"" encounter types.
 
These encounter types are used for vital signs, labs, etc. All things in which the ACP should be able to sign off on without a MD co-signing. We need to work to license, as we keep referring to. Our MD's are overloaded with work. Lets take away ""one more click""

Good Morning, 
  
Please share with Staff: 
  
If a patient who is presenting for a lab only visit that the recommendation is that they use the ""clinical support"" encounter type which will allow the site to place orders and charge capture along with allowing the provider to sign off on the encounter. 
  
We are finding that sites are using ""order only"" encounters and the lab tech/phlebotomist is performing the venipuncture but the note is not being sent to the provider to sign off.  We still need a physician signature since the lab tech/phlebotomist is operating under the direct supervision of the provider.  Remember this means that these must be signed off by a physician that was in the clinic at the time of service. 
  
The provider can be an ACP as they are allowed to supervise ancillary staff. 
  
If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact me. 
  
Thank you,

Allow Physicians to Place Inpatient Orders Using Canto
Became available with 2017 but did not make the cutoff for upgrade.
Physicians can place inpatient medication and procedure orders on the go using Canto. Instead of waiting until they're at their computers, physicians can enter orders right from their iPads and then make any necessary edits or changes once they return to a workstation. They can select orders from the following sources:
Default and suggested Quick Lists
Inpatient preference lists
Saved orders
Searching orders within the system
They can select from all orders other than classic panels and nested panels. Then, they can then edit the following order information:
Order-specific questions
Indications of use or reasons for exam
Any other order information can't be edited in Canto and must be entered by default, such as from a preference list or Quick List, for a physician to be able to sign the order in the app. Only orders with all required fields filled out can be signed directly in Canto, but all other orders can be pended or saved to be signed later in Hyperspace.","STRICHARDSON","","","NO","","0","","EPIC CARE INPATIENT ","APPLICATION SERVICES",""

Per RMH blood bank:
Now that the Epic upgrade is safely behind us, I was wondering if we could see about streamlining the order comments section in BOP.  Take a look at accession number M2940369 for an example (click on Information, Order Data, then look under Comments at bottom of screen).

Currently, based on the workflow/scheduling in Epic, the following Epic Encounter Types labeled - ""Orders Only"", "" Anticoagulation Mgt"" and ""Tech"" are often used for patients presenting to the practice for lab work. The current concern is that the Nurse is documenting their blood draw (i.e, venipuncture 36415, 36416) procedure in these encounter types.  Due to a Nurse  whom works under direct supervision of an MD, and for any service to be billed under an Supervising provider, the documentation needs to be signed off the Supervising MD.   Tina Bradshaw has spoke to Matt Rose who has also spoken to Dr. Speaker, Dr Speaker has indicated we would need to submit an optimization for this to happen due to this may require build or modification to these encounter types and would be a system wide change.   A nurse only visit type was suggested, but due to the workflow/scheduling in place, they felt  this might not be their preferred action why the Optimization was recommended.

1.	Fast-Track Opportunity Statement
Provide a description of the project and why the need is great enough to warrant a Fast-Track approval request. Consider some or all of the following questions:
a.	What service is being proposed and to what patient population?
Due to the loss of 2 inpatient psychiatrists at Carilion Saint Albans inpatient psychiatric unit, an urgent need existed beginning in mid-July 2017 to provide inpatient psychiatric evaluations at that facility.  The bylaws pertaining to tele-psychiatry provision at CNRV were reviewed by their vice president and medical staff president who stated there were no barriers to providing tele-psychiatry.  At the request of the Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, Dr. Bob Trestman, Dr. Milam began providing tele-psychiatry treatment on July 17, 2017 to a limited number of inpatients at Saint Albans who had either Medicaid, commercial insurance or no insurance (not Medicare patients).  Dr. Milam is credentialed to provide inpatient and ambulatory psychiatry at CNRV
b.	How does it improve access, quality, and convenience of care?
This service continues our ability to accept patients for inpatient psychiatric care without having to cap the inpatient since this at a much lower number which would result in increased bedding of psychiatric patients in Carilion's and other emergency departments.
c.	How might this service impact other services and departments at Carilion? Have you communicated with them? The ED뭩 at CNRV and CRMH are aware of, and grateful for, this service which will reduce boarding times in our ED뭩
d.	Please describe how this project aligns with Vision 20/20.
i.	Connected, Convenient, Collaborative care: The use of Telepsychiatry promotes connected health that is also convenient for the patient and increases access to much needed psychiatric care.
ii.	Healthy Communities: Improves access to mental health care in the Radford area which helps that community stay healthy
iii.	Clinical Advancement in Patient Safety
iv.	Innovation: The use of telemedicine is very innovative as a care delivery model
v.	Financial Vitality: Telepsychiatry can enable expansion of our market share in SW and SE Virginia
vi.	Workforce for the Future: The use of Telemedicine is one of the fastest growing strategies for proving healthcare for the future.

2.	Fast-Track Operations
In order to help the Committee understand operational and workflow issues with this proposal, please answer the following:
a.	Who is the project뭩 멵hampion and operational leadership, including Department Chair who must sign off on the proposal?  Dr. Thomas Milam is the Proposer and Physician Champion  in the Dept of Psychiatry and is supported by his Chair Dr. Robert Trestman
b.	Is this initiative tied to an external contract with another entity?  If so, what is the proposed initial term of the agreement? No. CNRV is part of Carilion
c.	Are there additional privileging or credentialing requirements? No. Dr. Milam is already privileged and credentialed at CNRV.
d.	What is the frequency of the service and how will scheduling take place? Daily use, Monday through Friday for now. Scheduling is done directly with Dr. Milam every morning and patients are seen at 10:30 daily M-F within the context of their treatment teams.
a.	Where will the provider be located? Dr. Milam뭩office in the Rehab building at Roanoke CRMH. Where will the patient be located? CNRV뭩 inpatient psych unit called St. Alban뭩
b.	What provider and support staff will be needed at both the patient site and provider site?  St. Alban뭩 has a SW and nurse that assist Dr. Milam with the scheduling and with seeing patients.

3.	Fast-Track Finance
In regard to financial impact, please answer the following:
a.	What are the relevant reimbursement and payer mix issues you anticipate? Dr. Milam will not be seeing any Medicare patients for the time being until issues about coverage of that area under a Next Gen waiver can be sorted out. Medicaid, uninsured and many commercial payers cover telepsychiatry in Virginia per previous work done in this area by the Telemedicine Steering Committee.
b.	 Please provide the incremental productivity and/or cost savings for this service and the significant assumptions to support these volumes for both the provider and patient locations. Currently, this service allows Dr. Milam to see between 2-6 patients daily, M-F, that would otherwise not be able to be seen due to capping needs beyond a certain level of provider availability. That generates income for Carilion that would otherwise be lost to other hospitals able to accommodate these patients.","TMMILLER2","40","","NO","RBFARRIS","0","3 - MEDIUM","UNDETERMINED","UNDETERMINED SERVICES",""

1.	Fast-Track Opportunity Statement
Provide a description of the project and why the need is great enough to warrant a Fast-Track approval request. Consider some or all of the following questions:
a.	What service is being proposed and to what patient population?
For approximately 1 year, Carilion Dept of Psychiatry psychiatrist Dr. Chuck Swanson has been providing telepsychiatry to the Piedmont Community Service Board (CSB) PACT (Psychiatric Assertive Community Treatment) Team via a telemedicine link established between Carilion and the Piedmont CSB. This PACT service involves community based mental health support workers visiting patients in their homes, and Dr. Swanson is able to be present with that team in the patients home via a telemedicine link (Vidyo by Carilion, Polycom by Piedmont.) Additionally, Dr. Swanson has periodically seen psychiatric  patients at the ambulatory clinic in Piedmont CSB뭩 building in Rocky Mount, VA via a telemedicine link. At Piedmont뭩 request, we plan to provide a Carilion psychiatric nurse practitioner to continue to develop that ambulatory telepsychiatry service give the severe shortage of mental health providers in the area.
b.	How does it improve access, quality, and convenience of care? Piedmont CSB has a limited number of mental health providers already. This NP will enable Carilion to grow our mental health service provision in Franklin County which is very underserved.
c.	How might this service impact other services and departments at Carilion? Have you communicated with them? Carilion Dept of Psychiatry already has a contract with Piedmont to provide these services so there is no major impact on other services. Hopefully the ambulatory service will enable psychiatric patients in the CFMH ED who are dispo뭗 hometo get quicker access to community mental health services and thereby reduce ED visits and psych readmissions.
d.	Please describe how this project aligns with Vision 20/20.
i.	Connected, Convenient, Collaborative care: The use of Telepsychiatry promotes connected health that is also convenient for the patient and increases access to much needed psychiatric care.
ii.	Healthy Communities: Improves access to mental health care in Franklin County which helps that community stay healthy
iii.	Clinical Advancement in Patient Safety

2.	Fast-Track Operations
In order to help the Committee understand operational and workflow issues with this proposal, please answer the following:
a.	Who is the project뭩 멵hampion and operational leadership, including Department Chair who must sign off on the proposal?  Dr. Milam is the Proposer, Dr. Chuck Swanson is the Physician Champion, both having the support of their Chair Dr. Robert Trestman.
b.	Is this initiative tied to an external contract with another entity?  If so, what is the proposed initial term of the agreement? Carlion Dept of Psychiatry currently has a contract to provide telepsychiatry at the Piedmont CSB.
c.	Are there additional privileging or credentialing requirements? Piedmont CSB is a state agency with whom we are contracted. No additional priv/cred is necessary.
d.	What is the frequency of the service and how will scheduling take place? The schedule is made in conjunction with Piedmont, using their scheduling staff and their HER, and patients are seen daily Monday through Friday.
a.	Where will the provider be located? Office in Rehab building at CRMH.         Where will the patient be located? Franklin County, either at the Piedmont CSB building (ambulatory site) or in patient뭩 homes (PACT Team.)
b.	What provider and support staff will be needed at both the patient site and provider site?  Dr. Swanson and a NP from Carilion. Piedmont provides the remaining staff at their expense.

3.	Fast-Track Finance
In regard to financial impact, please answer the following:
a.	What are the relevant reimbursement and payer mix issues you anticipate? Carilion is reimbursed on an hourly rate for all services provider to Piedmont CSB as stipulated in the contract.
b.	 Please provide the incremental productivity and/or cost savings for this service and the significant assumptions to support these volumes for both the provider and patient locations. A functioning PACT team is designed to serve the most seriously mentally ill in their service area with a goal to keep them well, encourage compliance with medications, and to intervene with support and psychiatric services early to prevent de-compensation and avoid unnecessary ED visits and costly hospitalization. The ambulatory services also maintains a mental health provider presence in a greatly underserved area, thus increasing access and ED utilization.
